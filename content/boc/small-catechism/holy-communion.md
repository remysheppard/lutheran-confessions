### _What is the Sacrament of the Altar?_

It is the true body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ, under the
bread and wine, for us Christians to eat and to drink, instituted
by Christ Himself.

### _Where is this written?_

The holy Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and St. Paul, write thus:

_Our Lord Jesus Christ, the same night in which He was betrayed, took bread: and when He had given thanks, He broke it, and gave it to His disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body, which is given for you. This do in remembrance of Me_.

_After the same manner also He took the cup, when He had supped, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Take, drink ye all of it. This cup is the new testament in My blood, which is shed for you for the remission of sins. This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of Me_.

### _What is the benefit of such eating and drinking?_

That is shown us in these words: _Given, and shed for you, for the remission of sins_; namely, that in the Sacrament forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation are given us through these words. For where there is forgiveness of sins, there is also life and salvation.

### _How can bodily eating and drinking do such great things?_

It is not the eating and drinking, indeed, that does them, but the words which stand here, namely: _Given, and shed for you, for the remission of sins_. Which words are, beside the bodily eating and drinking, as the chief thing in the Sacrament; and he that believes these words has what they say and express, namely, the forgiveness of sins.

### _Who, then, receives such Sacrament worthily?_

Fasting and bodily preparation is, indeed, a fine outward training; but he is truly worthy and well prepared who has faith in these words: _Given, and shed for you, for the remission of sins_.

But he that does not believe these words, or doubts, is unworthy and unfit; for the words _For you_ require altogether believing hearts.
