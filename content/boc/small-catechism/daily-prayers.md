### Morning Prayer

In the morning, when you rise, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross and say:

**In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.**

Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the [Creed](/boc/ecumenical-creeds/apostles-creed/) and the [Lord's Prayer](/boc/small-catechism/the-lords-prayer/). If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer:

**I thank Thee, my Heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son, that Thou hast kept me this night from all harm and danger; and I pray Thee to keep me this day also from sin and all evil, that all my doings and life may please Thee. For into Thy hands I commend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Thy holy angel be with me, that the Wicked Foe may have no power over me. Amen.**

Then go to your work with joy, singing a hymn, as the Ten Commandments, or what your devotion may suggest.

### Evening Prayer

In the evening, when you go to bed, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross and say:

**In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.**

Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the [Creed](/boc/ecumenical-creeds/apostles-creed/) and the [Lord's Prayer](/boc/small-catechism/the-lords-prayer/). If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer:

**I thank Thee, my Heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son, that Thou hast graciously kept me this day, and I pray Thee to forgive me all my sins, where I have done wrong, and graciously keep me this night. For into Thy hands I commend myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Thy holy angel be with me, that the Wicked Foe may have no power over me. Amen.**

Then go to sleep promptly and cheerfully.

## How the Head of the Family Should Teach His Household to Ask a Blessing and Return Thanks.

### Asking a Blessing

The children and servants shall go to the table with folded hands and reverently, and say:

**The eyes of all wait upon Thee, O Lord; and Thou givest them their meat in due season; Thou openest Thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.**

<small>***Note:** To satisfy the desire means that all animals receive so much to eat that they are on this account joyful and of good cheer; for care and avarice hinder such satisfaction.*</small>

Then the Lord's Prayer, and the prayer here following:

**Lord God, Heavenly Father, bless us and these Thy gifts, which we take from Thy bountiful goodness, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.**

### Returning Thanks.

Likewise also after the meal they shall reverently and with folded hands say:

**O give thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth forever. He giveth food to all flesh; He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry. He delighteth not in the strength of the horse; He taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that hope in His mercy.**

Then the Lord's Prayer and the prayer here following:

**We thank Thee, Lord God, Father, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, for all Thy benefits, who livest and reignest forever and ever. Amen.**
