  These are the chief articles which seem to be in controversy.
For although we might have spoken of more abuses, yet, to avoid
undue length, we have set forth the chief points, from which
the rest may be readily judged.   There have been great
complaints concerning indulgences, pilgrimages, and the abuse
of excommunications. The parishes have been vexed in many ways
by the dealers in indulgences. There were endless contentions
between the pastors and the monks concerning the parochial right,
confessions, burials, sermons on extraordinary occasions, and
  innumerable other things. Issues of this sort we have
passed over so that the chief points in this matter, having
been briefly set forth, might be the more readily understood.
  Nor has anything been here said or adduced to the
reproach of any one.   Only those things have been recounted
whereof we thought that it was necessary to speak, in order
that it might be understood that in doctrine and ceremonies
nothing has been received on our part against Scripture or the
Church Catholic. For it is manifest that we have taken most
diligent care that no new and ungodly doctrine should creep
into our churches.

  The above articles we desire to present in accordance with the
edict of Your Imperial Majesty, in order to exhibit our Confession
and let men see a summary of the doctrine of our teachers.  
If there is anything that any one might desire in this Confession,
we are ready, God willing, to present ampler information according
to the Scriptures.

  Your Imperial Majesty's faithful subjects:

  John, Duke of Saxony, Elector

  George, Margrave of Brandenburg.

  Ernest, Duke of Lueneberg.

  Philip, Landgrave of Hesse.

  John Frederick, Duke of Saxony.

  Francis, Duke of Lueneburg.

  Wolfgang, Prince of Anhalt.

  Senate and Magistracy of Nuremburg.

  Senate of Reutlingen.
