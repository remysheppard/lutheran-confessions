  Most Invincible Emperor, Caesar Augustus, Most Clement Lord:
Inasmuch as Your Imperial Majesty has summoned a Diet of the
Empire here at Augsburg to deliberate concerning measures against
the Turk, that most atrocious, hereditary, and ancient enemy
of the Christian name and religion, in what way, namely, effectually
to withstand his furor and assaults by strong and lasting military
provision;   and then also concerning dissensions in
the matter of our holy religion and Christian Faith, that in
this matter of religion the opinions and judgments of the parties
might be heard in each other's presence; and considered and
weighed   among ourselves in mutual charity, leniency,
and kindness, in order that, after the removal and correction
of such things as have been treated and understood in a different
manner in the writings on either side, these matters may be
settled and brought back to one simple truth and Christian concord,
  that for the future one pure and true religion may
be embraced and maintained by us, that as we all are under one
Christ and do battle under Him, so we may be able also to live
in unity and concord in the one Christian Church.

And inasmuch as we, the undersigned Elector and   Princes,
with others joined with us, have been called to the aforesaid
Diet the same as the other Electors, Princes, and Estates, in
obedient compliance with the Imperial mandate, we have promptly
come to Augsburg, and—what we do not mean to say as boasting—we
were among the first to be here.

  Accordingly, since even here at Augsburg at the very beginning
of the Diet, Your Imperial Majesty caused to be proposed to
the Electors, Princes, and other Estates of the Empire, amongst
other things, that the several Estates of the Empire, on the
strength of the Imperial edict, should set forth and submit
their opinions and judgments in the German and the Latin  
language, and since on the ensuing Wednesday, answer was given
to Your Imperial Majesty, after due deliberation, that we would
submit the Articles of our Confession for our side on next Wednesday,
therefore, in obedience to Your Imperial Majesty's  
wishes, we offer, in this matter of religion, the Confession
of our preachers and of ourselves, showing what manner of doctrine
from the Holy Scriptures and the pure Word of God has been up
to this time set forth in our lands, dukedoms, dominions, and
cities, and taught in our churches.

  And if the other Electors, Princes, and Estates of the Empire
will, according to the said Imperial proposition, present similar
writings, to wit, in Latin and German, giving their opinions
in this   matter of religion, we, with the Princes
and friends aforesaid, here before Your Imperial Majesty, our
most clement Lord are prepared to confer amicably concerning
all possible ways and means, in order that we may come together,
as far as this may be honorably done, and, the matter between
us on both sides being peacefully discussed without offensive
strife, the dissension, by God's help, may be done away and
brought back to one true accordant   religion; for
as we all are under one Christ and do battle under Him, we ought
to confess the one Christ, after the tenor of Your Imperial
Majesty's edict, and everything ought to be conducted according
to the truth of God; and this it is what, with most fervent
prayers, we entreat of God.

 
However, as regards the rest of the Electors, Princes, and Estates,
who constitute the other part, if no progress should be made,
nor some result be attained by this treatment of the cause of
religion after the manner in which Your Imperial Majesty has
wisely held that it should be dealt with and treated namely,
by such mutual presentation of writings and calm conferring
together among ourselves,   we at least leave with
you a clear testimony, that we here in no wise are holding back
from anything that could bring about Christian concord,—such
as could be effected with God and a good conscience,—as
  also Your Imperial Majesty and, next, the other Electors
and Estates of the Empire, and all who are moved by sincere
love and zeal for religion, and who will give an impartial hearing
to this matter, will graciously deign to take notice and to
understand this from this Confession of ours and of our associates.


 
Your Imperial Majesty also, not only once but often, graciously
signified to the Electors Princes, and Estates of the Empire,
and at the Diet of Spires held A.D. 1526, according to the form
of Your Imperial instruction and commission given and prescribed,
caused it to be stated and publicly proclaimed that  
Your Majesty, in dealing with this matter of religion, for certain
reasons which were alleged in Your Majesty's name, was not willing
to decide and could not determine anything, but that Your Majesty
would diligently use Your Majesty's office with the Roman Pontiff
for the convening of a General Council.   The same
matter was thus publicly set forth at greater length a year
ago at the last Diet which met at Spires.   There Your
Imperial Majesty, through His Highness Ferdinand, King of Bohemia
and Hungary, our friend and clement Lord, as well as through
the Orator and Imperial Commissioners caused this, among other
things, to be submitted: that Your Imperial Majesty had taken
notice of; and pondered, the resolution of Your Majesty's Representative
in the Empire, and of the President and Imperial Counselors,
and the Legates from other Estates convened at Ratisbon,  
concerning the calling of a Council, and that your Imperial
Majesty also judged it to be expedient to convene a Council;
and that Your Imperial Majesty did not doubt the Roman Pontiff
could be induced to   hold a General Council, because
the matters to be adjusted between Your Imperial Majesty and
the Roman Pontiff were nearing agreement and Christian reconciliation;
therefore Your Imperial Majesty himself signified that he would
endeavor to secure the said Chief Pontiff's consent for convening,
together with your Imperial Majesty such General Council, to
be published as soon as possible by letters that were to be
sent out.

 
If the outcome, therefore, should be such that the differences
between us and the other parties in the matter of religion should
not be amicably and in charity settled, then here, before Your
Imperial Majesty we make the offer in all obedience, in addition
to what we have already done, that we will all appear and defend
our cause in such a general, free Christian Council, for the
convening of which there has always been accordant action and
agreement of votes in all the Imperial Diets held during Your
Majesty's reign, on the part of the Electors, Princes, and other
Estates of the Empire.   To the assembly of this General
Council, and at the same time to Your Imperial Majesty, we have,
even before this, in due manner and form of law, addressed ourselves
and made appeal in this matter, by far the greatest and gravest.
To this   appeal, both to Your Imperial Majesty and
to a Council, we still adhere; neither do we intend nor would
it be possible for us, to relinquish it by this or any other
document, unless the matter between us and the other side, according
to the tenor of the latest Imperial citation should be amicably
and charitably settled, allayed, and brought to Christian concord;
  and regarding this we even here solemnly and publicly
testify.
