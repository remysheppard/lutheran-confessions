## Preface to the Christian Book of Concord

To the Readers, one and all, of these Writings of ours, we, the Electors, Princes, and Deputies of the
Holy Roman Empire in Germany, adherents of the Augsburg Confession, who have subscribed our
names to the same, announce and declare, according to the dignity and rank of each one, our devotion,
friendship, and greeting, combined with willing service.

### The Issues

  It is a remarkable favor of Almighty God that in these last times and in this old age of the world He has
willed, according to His unspeakable love, forbearance, and mercy, that after the darkness of papistical
superstitions the light of His Gospel and Word, through which alone we receive true salvation, should
arise and shine clearly and purely in Germany, our most beloved fatherland. And on this account, indeed,
a brief and succinct confession was prepared from the Word of God, and the most holy writings of the
Prophets and Apostles, and at the Diet of Augsburg, in the year 1530, was offered, by our most godly
ancestors, in the German and Latin languages, to the Emperor Charles V, of excellent memory, and laid
before [all] the deputies of the Empire, and finally, being circulated publicly among all men professing
Christian doctrine, and thus in the entire world, was diffused everywhere, and began to be current in the
mouths and speech of all.

  Afterwards many churches and schools embraced and defended this Confession as a symbol of the
present time in regard to the chief articles of faith, especially those involved in controversy with the
Romanists and various corruptions of the heavenly doctrine [sects], and with perpetual agreement have
appealed to it without any controversy and doubt. The doctrine comprised in it, which they knew both to
be supported by firm testimonies of Scripture, and to be approved by the ancient and accepted symbols,
they have also constantly judged to be the only and perpetual consensus of the truly believing Church,
which was formerly defended against manifold heresies and errors, and is now repeated.

  But it can be unknown to no one that, immediately after Dr. Martin Luther, that most distinguished hero,
endowed with most eminent piety, was removed from human affairs, Germany, our dear fatherland,
experienced most perilous times and most severe agitations. In these difficulties, and in the sad
distraction of a government before flourishing and well regulated, the enemy of mortals cunningly
labored to scatter in the churches and schools the seeds of false doctrine and dissensions, to excite
divisions combined with offense, and by these arts of his to corrupt the purity of the heavenly doctrine, to
sever the bond of Christian love and godly agreement, and to hinder and retard to a greater degree the
course of the most holy Gospel. It, is also known to all in what manner the enemies of the heavenly
doctrine seized this opportunity to disparage our churches and schools, to find covering for their errors,
to draw alarmed and erring consciences away from the purity of the Gospel-doctrine, in order to render
them more compliant in bearing and tolerating the yoke of the papal slavery, and in embracing also other
corruptions conflicting with God’s Word.

  To us, indeed, nothing could happen, either more agreeable, or which, we would judge, should be sought
for more earnestly and prayerfully from Almighty God, than that both our churches and our schools
should have persevered in the pure doctrine of God’s Word and in that longed-for and godly unanimity
of mind, and, as was the case while Luther was still alive, that they should have been regulated according
to the rule of the divine Word, and handed down to posterity in a godly and excellent way. We notice,
however, that, just as in the times of the Apostles, into those churches in which they themselves had
planted the Gospel of Christ corruptions were introduced by false brethren, so, on account of our sins and
the looseness of these times, this has been allowed by an angry God against our churches also.

  Wherefore, mindful of our duty, which, we know, has been divinely enjoined upon us, we think that we
ought diligently to apply ourselves to the labor of attacking in our provinces and realms the false
teachings which have been disseminated there, and are gradually insinuating themselves, as it were, into
the intimate acquaintance and familiarity of men, and that we should see to it that the subjects in our
government may persevere in the straight way of godliness and in the truth of the heavenly doctrine,
acknowledged and thus far retained and defended, and not be suffered to be led away from it. In this
matter, indeed, partly our most worthy predecessors, partly we ourselves, were eagerly at work, when, in
the year of Christ 1558, on the occasion of the Diet which was then being held by the Electors at
Frankfort on the Main, the resolution was adopted by a unanimous vote that a special, general assembly
should be held, where in a thorough, but nevertheless amicable manner there might be a conference
among us concerning such matters as are maliciously charged, by our adversaries, against [us and] our
churches and schools.

### The Naumburg Conference of 1561

  And, indeed, after these deliberations our predecessors, of godly and excellent memory, together with
some of us, assembled at Naumburg in Thuringia. On that occasion we took in hand the Augsburg
Confession, offered to the Emperor Charles V in the great assembly of the Empire at Augsburg in the
year 1530, and mentioned by us several times previously, and to that godly confession, built upon solid
testimonies of the truth, which cannot be shaken, and is expressed in the Word of God, we all subscribed
with one mind. In this way, of course, we meant to provide for the interests of posterity, and to enable
and urge them, as far as we could, to avoid false doctrines conflicting with God’s Word. This we did also
with the design that, both with his Imperial Majesty, our most clement lord, and also universally among
all, there might be a permanent testimony that it has never been our intention to wish to defend or spread
any new and strange dogma, but that we desired, God aiding us, to constantly support and retain the truth
which we professed at Augsburg in the year 1530. We were also led to entertain a not uncertain hope that
in this way not only those who oppose the pure evangelical doctrine would abstain from fabricated
charges and accusations, but also other good and well-disposed men would be attracted by this renewed
and repeated confession of ours, and, with greater zeal and care, would seek and investigate the truth of
the heavenly doctrine, which alone is our guide to salvation, and, out of regard for the salvation of the
soul and their eternal happiness, would assent to it, all further controversies and disputations being
rejected.

### The Naumburg Conference Failed

  But, not without agitation of mind, we were informed that this declaration of ours and that repetition of a
godly confession had too little weight with our adversaries, and that neither we nor our churches were
delivered from the most grievous slanders, arising from prejudice, which they had circulated against us
among the people; also, that those things which we have done, with the best intention and purpose, have
been received by the adversaries of the true religion in such a way as though we were so uncertain
concerning our [confession of faith and] religion, and so often had transfused it from one formula to
another that it was no longer clear to us or our theologians what is the Confession once offered to the
Emperor at Augsburg. These fictions of the adversaries have deterred and alienated many good men from
our churches, schools, doctrine, faith, and confession. To these disadvantages there is also added that,
under the pretext of the Augsburg Confession, the teaching conflicting with the institution of the Holy
Supper of the body and blood of Christ and also other corruptions were introduced here and there into the
churches and schools.

  When some godly men, lovers of peace and harmony, besides also learned theologians, had noticed all
these things, they judged that these slanders and the dissensions in religion which were constantly
increasing more and more, could not be better met than if the controverted articles would be thoroughly
and accurately set forth and explained from the Word of God, the false teachings would be rejected and
condemned, and, on the other hard, the truth divinely delivered be clearly and lucidly presented; because
they were convinced that by this method both silence could be imposed upon the adversaries, and the
more simple and godly be shown a sure way and plan as to how they should act in these dissensions, and,
aided by divine grace, could also in the future avoid corruptions of doctrine.

  In the beginning, therefore, the theologians communicated to one another certain writings concerning this
subject, sufficiently comprehensive, and derived from the Word of God, in which they showed clearly
and skilfully how these controversies, which were not without offense to the churches, could be put to
rest and removed from sight without any loss to the truth of the Gospel; for the result would be that the
opportunities and pretexts sought for slander would be cut off and removed from the adversaries. Finally
they took up and accurately and in the fear of God pondered and explained the controverted articles, and
accordingly in a special writing stated comprehensively in what way and by what method the dissensions
which had arisen could be settled in a right and godly manner.

  Having been informed of this godly purpose of the theologians, we have not only approved it, but have
also judged that it ought to be promoted by us with great earnestness and zeal, in view of the office and
duty divinely committed to us.

### The Torgau Conference of 1576

  And accordingly, upon the counsel of some other Electors and Princes agreeing with us in religion, we,
by the grace of God, Duke of Saxony, Elector, etc., summoned certain eminent and least suspected
theologians, who were also experienced and endowed with preeminent learning, to Torgau in the year
1576, for the purpose of promoting the godly design of harmony among the teachers of the Church.
When they had assembled, they conferred devoutly with one another concerning the controverted articles
and the peace document which we have just mentioned. And indeed, after prayers had first been offered
to Almighty God, and His praise and glory, they comprised, with extraordinary care and diligence,—the
Spirit of the Lord aiding them by His grace,—all those things which seemed to pertain to, and to be
required for, this deliberation in a very good and suitable document. Afterwards this book was
transmitted to some chief adherents of the Augsburg Confession, Electors, Princes, and Deputies, with
the request that they themselves, calling to their aid the most eminent and most learned theologians,
should read it with anxious care and godly zeal, should diligently examine it, and commit their opinion
and criticism upon it to writing, and, finally, express their judgment and the reasons therefore concerning
the whole and each part.

  Therefore, when we had received these criticisms, we found in them many godly and useful suggestions
how the transmitted declaration of the pure Christian doctrine could be fortified and strengthened against
corruptions and perversions by the testimonies of Holy Scripture, in order that in the course of time,
under its guise, godless doctrines might not be concealed, but an altogether unvarnished declaration of
the pure truth might be transmitted to posterity. Therefore, out of those things which had been considered
best when they came to us, that book of godly concord of which we spoke was composed, and completed
in the form in which it will be submitted.

  Then some of our rank (for at that time not all of us, nor some others as well, were able to do this, on
account of certain causes which were in the way), have caused this book to be recited article by article
and distinctly to the theologians, and the ministers of the church and of the schools collectively and
individually, and have caused them to be urged to a diligent and accurate consideration of those parts of
the doctrine which are contained in it.

  Accordingly, when they perceived that the explanation of the controverted articles, indeed, agreed
especially with the Word of God, and then with the Augsburg Confession, they received this Book of
Concord with a very ready mind and an expression of their gratitude towards God, as expressing the
godly and genuine meaning of the Augsburg Confession, having voluntarily, and indeed accurately,
pondered and considered it, and they approved it and subscribed to it, and publicly bore witness
concerning it with heart, mouth, and hand. Wherefore that godly agreement is called, and forever will be,
not only the harmonious and concordant confession of some few of our theologians, but, in general, of
the ministers of our churches and rectors of schools, jointly and severally, in our provinces and realms.

## The Role of the Augsburg Confession

  Now, our conferences and those of our illustrious predecessors which were undertaken with a godly and
sincere intention, first at Frankfort on the Main, and afterward at Naumburg, and were recorded in
writing, not only did not accomplish that end and peaceful settlement which was desired, but from them
even a defense for errors and false doctrines was sought by some, while it had never entered our mind, by
this writing of ours, either to introduce, furnish a cover for, and establish any false doctrine, or in the
least even to recede from the Confession presented in the year 1530 at Augsburg, but rather, as many of
us as participated in the transactions at Naumburg wholly reserved it to ourselves, and promised besides
that if, in the course of time, anything would be desired with respect to the Augsburg Confession, or as
often as necessity would seem to demand it, we would further declare all things thoroughly and at length.
And that is the reason why we have elaborated in this Book of Concord with great and godly agreement a
declaration of our constant and perpetual, wish, and a repetition of our Christian faith and confession.
Accordingly, in order that no persons may permit themselves to be disturbed by the charges of our
adversaries spun out of their own mind, by which they boast that not even we are certain which is the
true and genuine Augsburg Confession, but that both those who are now among the living and posterity
also may be clearly and firmly taught and informed what that godly Confession is which both we and the
churches and schools of our realms at all times professed and embraced, we emphatically testify that
after the pure and immutable truth of God’s Word we wish to embrace the first Augsburg Confession
alone which was presented to the Emperor Charles V, in the year 1530, at the famous Diet of Augsburg
(this alone we say), and no other; copies of which, deposited in the archives of our predecessors, of
excellent memory, who presented it in the Diet to Charles V himself, we caused to be compared by men
worthy of confidence (lest we should be found wanting in most accurate regard for diligence) with the
copy which was presented to the Emperor himself, and is preserved in the archives of the Holy Roman
Empire, and we are sure that our copies, both the Latin and the German, in all things correspond to it,
with like meaning. For this reason also we wished to insert the confession then presented in our
explanation, which will be submitted herewith or in the Book of Concord, in order that all may
understand that we have resolved to tolerate in our realms, churches, and schools no other doctrine than
that which, in the year 1530, was approved at Augsburg in a solemn confession, by the above-mentioned
Electors, Princes, and Deputies of the Empire. This Confession also, by the help of God, we will retain to
our last breath, when we shall go forth from this life to the heavenly fatherland, to appear with joyful and undaunted mind and with a pure conscience before the tribunal of our Lord Jesus Christ. We hope,
therefore, that our adversaries will hereafter spare both us and the ministers of our churches, and not
employ these customary and most grievous accusations, that we cannot decide among ourselves upon
anything as certain concerning our faith, and that, on this account, we are forging new confessions almost
every year, yea, even every month.

### The Second Edition of the Augsburg Confession

  Moreover, as to the second edition of the Augsburg Confession, of which mention is made also in the
transactions at Naumburg, we notice, what is also known to all, that, under the pretext of the words of
this latter edition, some have wanted to cover and conceal corruptions with respect to the Lord’s Supper
and other errors, and by means of published writings have attempted to obtrude them upon an ignorant
populace; nor have they been moved by the distinct words of the Augsburg Confession, (which was first
presented,) by which these errors are openly rejected, and from which a far different meaning than they
wish can be shown. Therefore we have decided in this writing to testify publicly, and to inform all, that
we wished neither then nor now in any way to defend, or excuse, or to approve, as though agreeing with
the Gospel doctrine, false and godless doctrines and opinions which may lie concealed under certain
coverings of words. We, indeed, never received the latter edition in a sense differing in any part from the
former which was presented. Neither do we judge that other useful writings of Dr. Philip Melanchthon,
or of Brenz, Urban Rhegius, Pomeranus, etc., should be rejected and condemned, so far as, in all things,
they agree with the norm which has been set forth in the Book of Concord.

  Now, although some theologians, and among them Luther himself, when they treated of the Lord’s
Supper, were drawn, against their will, by their adversaries to disputations concerning the personal union
of the two natures in Christ, nevertheless our theologians in the Book of Concord, and by the norm of
sound doctrine which is in it, testify that both our constant and perpetual opinion and that of this book is that with regard to the Lord’s Supper godly men should be led to no other foundations than to those of
the words of institution of the testament of our Lord Jesus Christ. For since He is both almighty and true,
it is easy for Him to do those things which He has both instituted and promised in His Word. And indeed,
when this foundation will not be assailed by their adversaries, they will not contend in this kind of
argument concerning other methods of proof, but, in true simplicity of faith, will firmly insist upon the
very plain words of Christ, which method is the safest, and is best suited to the instruction of uneducated
men; for those things which have been discussed with greater exactness they do not understand. But
indeed, since this our assertion and the simple meaning of the words of Christ’s testament are assailed by
the adversaries, and rejected as godless and conflicting with the nature of true faith, and finally are
claimed to be contrary to the Apostles’ Creed (especially to the statements concerning the incarnation of
the Son of God, His ascension into heaven, and His sitting at the right hand of the almighty power and
majesty of God) and therefore to be false, it must be shown by a true and thorough interpretation of these
articles that our opinion differs neither from the words of Christ nor from these articles.

## The Book of Concord

  As to the phrases and forms of expression which are employed in this Book of Concord, when we treat of
the majesty of the human nature in the person of Christ, elevated and placed at the right hand of God, in
order to remove all subtle suspicions and causes of offense which might arise from the different
significations of the word abstract, (as both the schools and the fathers have hitherto employed this
term,) our theologians in distinct and express words wish to testify that this majesty is in no way to be
ascribed to the human nature of Christ outside of the personal union, neither are we to grant that the
human nature possesses this majesty as its own or by itself (even in the personal union) essentially,
formally, habitually, subjectively. (The schools like these terms, although they are not good Latin.) For if
we would adopt this method both of speaking and teaching, the divine and human natures with their
properties would be confounded, and the human, with respect to its essence and properties, would be
made equal to the divine, yea, indeed, would be altogether denied. Therefore the theologians judge that
we ought to believe that this occurs according to the method and economy of the hypostatic union, as
learned antiquity has spoken cautiously concerning this subject, that it is a mystery so great as to exceed
all the powers of our natural ability and understanding.

  As to the condemnations, censures, and rejections of godless doctrines, and especially of that which has
arisen concerning the Lord’s Supper, these indeed had to be expressly set forth in this our declaration and
thorough explanation and decision of controverted articles, not only that all should guard against these
condemned doctrines, but also for certain other reasons could in no way have been passed by. Thus, as it
is in no way our design and purpose to condemn those men who err from a certain simplicity of mind,
but are not blasphemers against the truth of the heavenly doctrine, much less, indeed, entire churches,
which are either under the Roman Empire of the German nation or elsewhere; nay, rather has it been our
intention and disposition in this manner openly to censure and condemn only the fanatical opinions and
their obstinate and blasphemous teachers, (which, we judge, should in no way be tolerated in our
dominions, churches, and schools,) because these errors conflict with the express Word of God, and that,
too, in such a way that they cannot be reconciled with it. We have undertaken this also for this reason,
viz., that all godly persons might be warned diligently to avoid them. For we have no doubt whatever that
even in those churches which have hitherto not agreed with us in all things many godly and by no means
wicked men are found who follow their own simplicity, and do not understand aright the matter itself,
but in no way approve the blasphemies which are cast forth against the Holy Supper as it is administered
in our churches, according to Christ’s institution, and, with the unanimous approval of all good men, is
taught in accordance with the words of the testament itself. We are also in great hope that, if they would
be taught aright concerning all these things, the Spirit of the Lord aiding them, they would agree with us,
and with our churches and schools, to the infallible truth of God’s Word. And assuredly, the duty is
especially incumbent upon all the theologians and ministers of the Church, that with such moderation as
is becoming they teach from the Word of God also those who either from a certain simplicity or
ignorance have erred from the truth, concerning the peril of their salvation, and that they fortify them
against corruptions lest perhaps, while the blind are leaders of the blind, all may perish. Wherefore, by
this writing of ours, we testify in the sight of Almighty God and before the entire Church that it has never been our purpose, by means of this godly formula for union to create trouble or danger to the godly who to-day are suffering persecution. For, as we have already entered into the fellowship of grief with them, moved by Christian love, so we are shocked at the persecution and most grievous tyranny which with
such severity is exercised against these poor men, and sincerely detest it. For in no way do we consent to
the shedding of that innocent blood, which undoubtedly will be required with great severity from the
persecutors at the awful judgment of the Lord and before the tribunal of Christ, and they will then
certainly render a most strict account, and suffer fearful punishment.

  In regard to these matters (as we have mentioned above) it has always been our purpose that in our lands,
dominions, schools, and churches no other doctrine be proclaimed and accurately set forth than that
which is founded upon the Word of God, and contained in the Augsburg Confession and the Apology,
(and that, too, when understood properly in its genuine sense,) and that opinions conflicting with these be
not admitted; and indeed, with this design, this formula of agreement was begun and completed.
Therefore before God and all mortals we once more declare and testify that in the declaration of the
controverted articles, of which mention has already been made several times, we are not introducing a
new confession, or one different from that which was presented in the year 1530 to Charles V, of happy
memory, but that we wished indeed to lead our churches and schools, first of all, to the fountains of Holy
Scripture, and to the Creeds, and then to the Augsburg Confession, of which we have before made
mention. We most earnestly exhort that especially the young men who are being educated for the holy
ministry of the churches and schools be instructed in this faithfully and diligently, in order that the pure doctrine and profession of our faith may, by the help of the Holy Ghost, be preserved and propagated
also to our posterity, until the glorious advent of Jesus Christ, our only Redeemer and Savior.
Since, therefore, such is the case, and being instructed from the Prophetic and Apostolic Scriptures, we
are sure concerning our doctrine and confession, and by the grace of the Holy Ghost our minds and
consciences have been confirmed to a greater degree, we have thought that this Book of Concord ought
to be published. For it seemed exceedingly necessary that, amidst so many errors that had arisen in our
times, as well as causes of offense, variances, and these long-continued dissensions, there should exist a
godly explanation and agreement concerning all these controversies, derived from God’s Word,
according to the terms of which the pure doctrine might be discriminated and separated from the false.

Besides, this matter is of importance also in this respect, viz., that troublesome and contentious men, who do not suffer themselves to be bound to any formula of the pure doctrine, may not have the liberty,
according to their good pleasure, to excite controversies which furnish ground for offense, and to publish
and contend for extravagant opinions. For the result of these things, at length, is that the pure doctrine is obscured and lost, and nothing is transmitted to posterity except academical opinions and suspensions of
judgment. To these considerations was also added this that, agreeably to the office committed to us by
God, we understand that we owe our subjects this, viz., that we should diligently care for the things
which pertain to this life and the life to come, and that we should take pains, with the greatest earnestness and to our utmost ability, to attend to those matters which promote the extension of God’s name and glory, the propagation of His Word, (from which alone we hope for salvation,) the peace and tranquillity
of churches and schools, and the instruction and consolation of disturbed consciences, especially since it
is certainly a settled fact with us that this salutary work of Christian concord has already been longed for
and expected with anxious prayers and the greatest desire by many good and sincere men both of the
highest and the lowest rank. For from the beginning of this work of peaceful settlement, indeed, we have
not been of the opinion, neither are we even now, that this work of concord, which is so salutary and
exceedingly necessary, should be removed from the eyes of men, and altogether concealed, and that the
light of heavenly truth should be placed under a bushel or table; wherefore we ought in no wise to defer
its publication. Nor do we doubt that all the godly who are lovers of the heavenly truth, and of concord
pleasing to God, will approve, together with us, of this salutary, useful, godly, and very necessary
undertaking, and that they will act so that nothing may be wanting in them, even to the greatest effort,
whereby the glory of God and the common welfare in both temporal and eternal things may be promoted.

## Conclusion

  We indeed (to repeat in conclusion what we have mentioned several times above) have wished, in this
work of concord, in no way to devise what is new, or to depart from the truth of the heavenly doctrine
which our ancestors, renowned for their piety, as well as we ourselves, have acknowledged and
professed. We mean that doctrine, which, having been derived from the Prophetic and Apostolic
Scriptures, is contained in the three ancient Creeds, in the Augsburg Confession, presented in the year
1530 to the Emperor Charles V, of excellent memory, then in the Apology, which was added to this, in
the Smalcald Articles, and lastly in both the Catechisms of that excellent man, Dr. Luther. Therefore we
also have determined not to depart even a finger’s breadth either from the subjects themselves, or from
the phrases which are found in them, but, the Spirit of the Lord aiding us, to persevere constantly, with
the greatest harmony, in this godly agreement, and we intend to examine all controversies according to
this true norm and declaration of the pure doctrine. Then, also with the rest of the Electors, Princes, and
Deputies of the Holy Roman Empire, and other kings, princes, and magnates of the Christian state, in
accordance with the constitution of the Holy Empire, and the agreements which we have with them, we
determined and desired to cultivate peace and harmony, and to render to each one, according to his rank,
all duties belonging to us, together with the offices of friendship.

  Besides, having made known our objects, we will also earnestly apply ourselves with great strictness and
the most ardent zeal to the defense of this work of concord, by diligent visitations of the churches and
schools in our realms, oversight of printing offices, and other salutary means, according to occasions and
circumstances which may be offered to ourselves and others. We will also take pains, if either
controversies already composed should be renewed, or new controversies concerning religion should
arise, to remove and settle them betimes, for the purpose of avoiding offense, without long and
dangerous digressions.
