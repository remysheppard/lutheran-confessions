Title: The Apostles' Creed
weight: 1
---

I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.

And in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord; who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried; He descended into hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.

I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy catholic\* Church, the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. Amen.

\* catholic means "universal" and is not a reference to the Roman Catholic Church.
