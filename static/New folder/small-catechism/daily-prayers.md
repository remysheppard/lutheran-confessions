#### How the head of the family should teach his household to pray morning and evening

**Morning Prayer.**

In the morning, when you rise, you shall bless yourself with
the holy cross and say:

**In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.**

Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord's
Prayer. If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little
prayer:

**I thank Thee, my
Heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son, that Thou
hast kept me this night from all harm and danger; and I pray
Thee to keep me this day also from sin and all evil, that all
my doings and life may please Thee. For into Thy hands I commend
myself, my body and soul, and all things. Let Thy holy angel
be with me, that the Wicked Foe may have no power over me. Amen.**

Then go to your work with joy, singing a hymn, as the Ten Commandments,
or what your devotion may suggest.

 **Evening
Prayer.**

In the evening, when you go to bed, you shall bless yourself
with the holy cross and say:

**In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.**

Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord's
Prayer. If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little
prayer:

**I thank Thee, my Heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, Thy dear Son, that Thou
hast graciously kept me this day, and I pray Thee to forgive
me all my sins, where I have done wrong, and graciously keep
me this night. For into Thy hands I commend myself, my body
and soul, and all things. Let Thy holy angel be with me, that
the Wicked Foe may have no power over me. Amen.**

Then go to sleep promptly and cheerfully.


#### How the Head of the Family Should Teach His Household to Ask a Blessing and Return Thanks.

**Asking a Blessing**

The children and servants shall go to the table with folded hands
and reverently, and say:

**The eyes of all wait upon Thee, O Lord; and Thou givest them their
meat in due season; Thou openest Thine hand, and satisfiest
the desire of every living thing.**

_Note_: To satisfy
the desire means that all animals receive so much to eat that
they are on this account joyful and of good cheer; for care
and avarice hinder such satisfaction.

Then the Lord's Prayer, and the prayer here following:

**Lord God, Heavenly Father, bless us and these Thy gifts, which we
take from Thy bountiful goodness, through Jesus Christ, our
Lord. Amen.**

**Returning Thanks.**

Likewise also after the meal they shall reverently and with folded hands
say:

**O give
thanks unto the Lord, for He is good; for His mercy endureth
forever. He giveth food to all flesh; He giveth to the beast
his food, and to the young ravens which cry. He delighteth not
in the strength of the horse; He taketh not pleasure in the
legs of a man. The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him,
in those that hope in His mercy.**

Then the Lord's Prayer and the prayer here following:

**We thank Thee, Lord God, Father, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, for
all Thy benefits, who livest and reignest forever and ever.
Amen.**
