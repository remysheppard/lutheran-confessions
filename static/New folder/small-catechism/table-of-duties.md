#### Certain passages of scripture for various holy orders and positions, admonishing them about their duties and responsibilities

**For Bishops, Pastors, and Preachers.**

A bishop
must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober,
of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach; not given
to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient,
not a brawler, not covetous; one that ruleth well his own house,
having his children in subjection with all gravity; not a novice;
holding fast the faithful Word as he hath been taught, that
he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince
the gainsayers. 1 Tim. 3:2ff ; Titus 1:6.

**What the Hearers Owe to Their Pastors.**

Even
so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the Gospel
should live of the Gospel. 1 Cor. 9:14. Let him that is taught
in the Word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
Gal. 6:6. Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of
double honor, especially they who labor in the Word and doctrine.
For the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth
out the corn; and the laborer is worthy of his reward. 1 Tim.
5:17-18. Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit
yourselves; for they watch for your souls as they that must
give account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief;
for that is unprofitable for you. Heb. 13:17.]

**Concerning Civil Government.**

Let
every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For the power
which exists anywhere is ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth
the power resisteth the ordinance of God; and they that resist
shall receive to themselves damnation. For he beareth not the
sword in vain; for he is the minister of God, a revenger to
execute wrath upon him that doeth evil. Rom. 13:1-4.

**What Subjects Owe to the Magistrates.**

Render
unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's. Matt. 22:21. Let
every soul be subject unto the higher powers, etc. Wherefore
ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience'
sake. For, for this cause pay ye tribute also; for they are
God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.
Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute
is due; custom, to whom custom; fear, to whom fear; honor, to
whom honor. Rom. 13:1,5ff. I exhort, therefore, that, first
of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of
thanks be made for all men; for kings and for all that are in
authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
godliness and honesty. 1 Tim. 2:1f Put them in mind to be subject
to principalities and powers, etc. Titus 3:1. Submit yourselves
to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it be
to the king as supreme, or unto governors as unto them that
are sent by him, etc. 1 Pet. 2:13f ]

**For Husbands.**

Ye husbands,
dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor unto
the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together
of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered. 1 Pet.
3:7. And be not bitter against them. Col. 3:9.

**For Wives.**

Wives,
submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord,
even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose daughters
ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.
1 Pet. 3:6; Eph. 5:22.

**For Parents.**

Ye fathers,
provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord. Eph. 6:4.

**For Children.**

Children,
obey your parents in the Lord; for this is right. Honor thy
father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise:
that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on
the earth. Eph. 6:1-3.

**For Male and Female Servants, Hired Men, and Laborers.**

Servants,
be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh,
with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto
Christ; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but as the servants
of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will
doing service as to the Lord, and not to men; knowing that whatsoever
good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord,
whether he be bond or free. Eph. 6:5ff ; Col. 3:22.

**For Masters and Mistresses.**

Ye masters,
do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening, knowing
that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect
of persons with Him. Eph. 6:9; Col. 4:1.

**For Young Persons in General.**

Likewise,
ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you
be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility; for
God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. Humble
yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God that He
may exalt you in due time. 1 Pet. 5:5-6.

**For Widows.**

She
that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth
in supplications and prayers night and day. But she that liveth
in pleasure is dead while she liveth. 1 Tim. 5:5-6.

**For All in Common.**

Thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Herein are comprehended
all the commandments. Rom. 13:8ff And persevere in prayer for
all men. 1 Tim. 2:1-2.


_Let each his lesson learn with care_,

_And all the household well shall fare_.
