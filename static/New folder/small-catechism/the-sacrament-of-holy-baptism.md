#### _As the head of the family should teach it in a simple way to his household._

**First.**

_What is Baptism?_

--Answer: Baptism
is not simple water only, but it is the water comprehended in
God's command and connected with God's Word.

_Which is that word of God?_

--Answer:  Christ, our Lord, says in the last chapter of Matthew: _Go ye into
all the world and teach all nations_, _baptizing them
in the name of the Father_, _and of the Son_, _and
of the Holy Ghost_.

&nbsp;

**Secondly.**

_What does Baptism give or profit?_

--Answer:  It works
forgiveness of sins, delivers from death and the devil, and
gives eternal salvation to all who believe this, as the words
and promises of God declare.

_Which are such words and promises of God?_ 

--Answer: Christ,
our Lord, says in the last chapter of Mark: _He that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall
be damned_.

&nbsp;

**Thirdly.**

_How can water do such great things?_

--Answer: It is
not the water indeed that does them, but the word of God which
is in and with the water, and faith, which trusts such word
of God in the water. For without the word of God the water is
simple water and no baptism. But with the word of God it is
a baptism, that is, a gracious water of life and a washing of
regeneration in the Holy Ghost, as St. Paul says, Titus, chapter
three: _By the washing of regeneration and renewing of the
Holy Ghost_, _which He shed on us abundantly through
Jesus Christ_, _our Savior_, _that_, _being
justified by His grace_, _we should be made heirs according
to the hope of eternal life. This is a faithful saying_.

&nbsp;

**Fourthly.**

_What does such baptizing with water signify?_

--Answer: It signifies
that the old Adam in us should, by daily contrition and repentance,
be drowned and die with all sins and evil lusts, and, again,
a new man daily come forth and arise; who shall live before
God in righteousness and purity forever.

_Where is this written?_ 

--Answer: St. Paul says Romans, chapter 6: _We are buried with Christ by
Baptism into death_, _that_, _like as He was raised
up from the dead by the glory of the Father_, _even so
we also should walk in newness of life_.
