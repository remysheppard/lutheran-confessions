{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Since Pope
Paul III convoked a Council last year, to assemble at Mantua
about Whitsuntide, and afterwards transferred it from Mantua,
so that it is not yet known where he will or can fix it, and
we on our part either had to expect that we would be summoned
also to the Council or [to fear that we would] be condemned
unsummoned, I was directed to compile and collect the articles
of our doctrine [in order that it might be plain] in case of
deliberation as to what and how far we would be both willing
and able to yield to the Papists, and in what points we intended
to persevere and abide to the end.

{{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} I have
accordingly compiled these articles and presented them to our
side. They have also been accepted and unanimously confessed
by our side, and it has been resolved that, in case the Pope
with his adherents should ever be so bold as seriously and in
good faith, without lying and cheating, to hold a truly free
[legitimate] Christian Council (as, indeed, he would be in duty
bound to do), they be publicly delivered in order to set forth
the Confession of our Faith.

{{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} But though
the Romish court is so dreadfully afraid of a free Christian
Council, and shuns the light so shamefully, that it has [entirely]
removed, even from those who are on its side, the hope that
it will ever permit a free Council, much less that it will itself
hold one, whereat, as is just, they [many Papists] are greatly
offended and have no little trouble on that account [are disgusted
with this negligence of the Pope], since they notice thereby
that the Pope would rather see all Christendom perish and all
souls damned than suffer either himself or his adherents to
be reformed even a little, and his [their] tyranny to be limited,
nevertheless I have determined meanwhile to publish these articles
in plain print, so that, should I die before there would be
a Council (as I fully expect and hope, because the knaves who
flee the light and shun the day take such wretched pains to
delay and hinder the Council), those who live and remain after
me may have my testimony and confession to produce, in addition
to the Confession which I have issued previously, whereby up
to this time I have abided, and, by God's grace, will abide.


{{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For what
shall I say? How shall I complain? I am still living, writing,
preaching, and lecturing daily; [and] yet there are found such
spiteful men, not only among the adversaries, but also false
brethren that profess to be on our side, as dare to cite my
writings and doctrine directly against myself, and let me look
on and listen, although they know well that I teach otherwise,
and as wish to adorn their venom with my labor, and under my
name to [deceive and] mislead the poor people. [Good God!] Alas!
what first will happen when I am dead?

{{< hiddenanchor 5 >}}5{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Indeed,
I ought to reply to everything while I am still living. But,
again, how can I alone stop all the mouths of the devil? especially
of those (as they all are poisoned) who will not hear or notice
what we write, but solely exercise themselves with all diligence
how they may most shamefully pervert and corrupt our word in
every letter. These I let the devil answer, or at last Gods
wrath, as they deserve. {{< hiddenanchor 6 >}}6{{< /hiddenanchor >}} I often think of the good
Gerson, who doubts whether anything good should be [written and]
published. If it is not done, many souls are neglected who could
be delivered; but if it is done, the devil is there with malignant,
villainous tongues without number which envenom and pervert
everything, so that nevertheless the fruit [the usefulness of
the writings] is prevented. {{< hiddenanchor 7 >}}7{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Yet what they gain thereby
is manifest. For while they have lied so shamefully against
us and by means of lies wished to retain the people, God has
constantly advanced His work, and been making their following
ever smaller and ours greater, and by their lies has caused
and still causes them to be brought to shame.

{{< hiddenanchor 8 >}}8{{< /hiddenanchor >}} I must
tell a story. There was a doctor sent here to Wittenberg from
France, who said publicly before us that his king was sure and
more than sure, that among us there is no church, no magistrate,
no married life, but all live promiscuously as cattle, and each
one does as he pleases. {{< hiddenanchor 9 >}}9{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Imagine now, how will those
who by their writings have instilled such gross lies into the
king and other countries as the pure truth, look at us on that
day before the judgment-seat of Christ? Christ, the Lord and
Judge of us all, knows well that they lie and have [always]
lied, His sentence they in turn, must hear; that I know certainly.
God convert to repentance those who can be converted! Regarding
the rest it will be said, Woe, and, alas! eternally.

{{< hiddenanchor 10 >}}10{{< /hiddenanchor >}} But to
return to the subject. I verily desire to see a truly Christian
Council [assembled some time], in order that many matters and
persons might be helped. Not that we need it, for our churches
are now, through God's grace, so enlightened and equipped with
the pure Word and right use of the Sacraments, with knowledge
of the various callings and of right works, that we on our part
ask for no Council, and on such points have nothing better to
hope or expect from a Council. But we see in the bishoprics
everywhere so many parishes vacant and desolate that one's heart
would break, and yet neither the bishops nor canons care how
the poor people live or die, for whom nevertheless Christ has
died, and who are not permitted to hear Him speak with them
as the true Shepherd with His sheep. {{< hiddenanchor 11 >}}11{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This causes
me to shudder and fear that at some time He may send a council
of angels upon Germany utterly destroying us, like Sodom and
Gomorrah, because we so wantonly mock Him with the Council.


{{< hiddenanchor 12 >}}12{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Besides
such necessary ecclesiastical affairs, there would be also in
the political estate innumerable matters of great importance
to improve. There is the disagreement between the princes and
the states; usury and avarice have burst in like a flood, and
have become lawful [are defended with a show of right]; wantonness,
lewdness, extravagance in dress, gluttony, gambling, idle display,
with all kinds of bad habits and wickedness, insubordination
of subjects, of domestics and laborers, of every trade, also
the exactions [and most exorbitant selling prices] of the peasants
(and who can enumerate all?) have so increased that they cannot
be rectified by ten Councils and twenty Diets. {{< hiddenanchor 13 >}}13{{< /hiddenanchor >}} If
such chief matters of the spiritual and worldly estates as are
contrary to God would be considered in the Council, they would
have all hands so full that the child's play and absurdity of
long gowns [official insignia], large tonsures, broad cinctures
[or sashes], bishops' or cardinals' hats or maces, and like
jugglery would in the mean time be forgotten. If we first had
performed God's command and order in the spiritual and secular
estate, we would find time enough to reform food, clothing, tonsures,
and surplices. But if we want to swallow such camels, and, instead,
strain at gnats, let the beams stand and judge the motes, we
also might indeed be satisfied with the Council.

{{< hiddenanchor 14 >}}14{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Therefore
I have presented few articles; for we have without this so many
commands of God to observe in the Church, the state, and the
family that we can never fulfil them. What, then, is the use,
or what does it profit that many decrees and statutes thereon
are made in the Council, especially when these chief matters
commanded of God are neither regarded nor observed? Just as
though He were bound to honor our jugglery as a reward of our
treading His solemn commandments under foot. But our sins weigh
upon us and cause God not to be gracious to us; for we do not
repent, and, besides, wish to defend every abomination.

{{< hiddenanchor 15 >}}15{{< /hiddenanchor >}} O Lord
Jesus Christ, do Thou Thyself convoke a Council, and deliver
Thy servants by Thy glorious advent! The Pope and his adherents
are done for; they will have none of Thee. Do Thou, then, help
us, who are poor and needy, who sigh to Thee, and beseech Thee
earnestly, according to the grace which Thou hast given us,
through Thy Holy Ghost, who liveth and reigneth with Thee and
the Father, blessed forever. Amen.
