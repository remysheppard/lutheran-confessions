{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This office
[of the Law] the New Testament retains and urges, as St. Paul,
Rom. 1:18 does, saying: _The wrath of God is revealed from
heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men_.
Again, Rom 3:19: _All the world is guilty before God. No man
is righteous before Him_. And Christ says, John 16:8: _The
Holy Ghost will reprove the world of sin._

{{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This, then,
is the thunderbolt of God by which He strikes in a heap [hurls
to the ground] both manifest sinners and false saints [hypocrites],
and suffers no one to be in the right [declares no one righteous],
but drives them all together to terror and despair. This is
the hammer, as Jeremiah 23:29 says: _Is not My Word like
a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces_? This is not _activa
contritio_ or manufactured repentance, but _passiva contritio_
[torture of conscience], true sorrow of heart, suffering and
sensation of death.

{{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This, then,
is what it means to begin true repentance; and here man must
hear such a sentence as this: You are all of no account, whether
you be manifest sinners or saints [in your own opinion]; you
all must become different and do otherwise than you now are
and are doing [no matter what sort of people you are], whether
you are as great, wise, powerful, and holy as you may. Here
no one is [righteous, holy], godly, etc.

{{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} But to
this office the New Testament immediately adds the consolatory
promise of grace through the Gospel, which must be believed,
as Christ declares, Mark 1:15 _: Repent and believe the Gospel_,
_i.e_., become different and do otherwise, and believe
My promise. And John, preceding Him, is called a preacher of
repentance, however, for the remission of sins, _i.e_.,
John was to accuse all, and convict them of being sinners, that
they might know what they were before God, and might acknowledge
that they were lost men, and might thus be prepared for the
Lord, to receive grace, and to expect and accept from Him the
remission of sins. Thus also Christ Himself says, Luke 24:47:
{{< hiddenanchor 6 >}}6{{< /hiddenanchor >}} _Repentance and remission of sins must be preached
in My name among all nations_.

{{< hiddenanchor 7 >}}7{{< /hiddenanchor >}} But whenever
the Law alone, without the Gospel being added exercises this
its office there is [nothing else than] death and hell, and
man must despair, like Saul and Judas; as St. Paul, Rom. 7:10, says: _Through sin the Law killeth_. {{< hiddenanchor 8 >}}8{{< /hiddenanchor >}} On the
other hand, the Gospel brings consolation and remission not
only in one way, but through the word and Sacraments, and the
like, as we shall hear afterward in order that [thus] there
is _with the Lord plenteous redemption_, as Ps. 130:7
says against the dreadful captivity of sin.

{{< hiddenanchor 9 >}}9{{< /hiddenanchor >}} However,
we must now contrast the false repentance of the sophists with
true repentance, in order that both may be the better understood.

## _Of the False Repentance of the Papists_.

{{< hiddenanchor 10 >}}10{{< /hiddenanchor >}} It was
impossible that they should teach correctly concerning repentance,
since they did not [rightly] know the real sins [the real sin].
For, as has been shown above, they do not believe aright concerning
original sin, but say that the natural powers of man have remained
[entirely] unimpaired and incorrupt; that reason can teach aright,
and the will can in accordance therewith do aright [perform
those things which are taught]; that God certainly bestows His
grace when a man does as much as is in him, according to his
free will.

{{< hiddenanchor 11 >}}11{{< /hiddenanchor >}} It had
to follow thence [from this dogma] that they did [must do] penance
only for actual sins, such as wicked thoughts to which a person
yields (for wicked emotion [concupiscence, vicious feelings,
and inclinations], lust and improper dispositions [according
to them] are not sins), and for wicked words and wicked deeds,
which free will could readily have omitted.

{{< hiddenanchor 12 >}}12{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And of
such repentance they fix three parts, contrition, confession,
and satisfaction, with this [magnificent] consolation and promise
added: If man truly repent, [feel remorse,] confess, render
satisfaction, he thereby would have merited forgiveness, and
paid for his sins before God [atoned for his sins and obtained
a plenary redemption]. Thus in repentance they instructed men
to repose confidence in their own works. {{< hiddenanchor 13 >}}13{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Hence the
expression originated, which was employed in the pulpit when
public absolution was announced to the people: _Prolong O
God_, _my life_, _until I shall make satisfaction
for my sins and amend my life._

{{< hiddenanchor 14 >}}14{{< /hiddenanchor >}} There
was here [profound silence and] no mention of Christ nor faith;
but men hoped by their own works to overcome and blot out sins
before God. And with this intention we became priests and monks,
that we might array ourselves against sin.

{{< hiddenanchor 15 >}}15{{< /hiddenanchor >}} As to
contrition, this is the way it was done: Since no one could
remember all his sins (especially as committed through an entire
year), they inserted this provision, namely, that if an unknown
sin should be remembered later [if the remembrance of a concealed
sin should perhaps return], this also must be repented of and
confessed, etc. Meanwhile they were [the person was] commended
to the grace of God.

{{< hiddenanchor 16 >}}16{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Moreover,
since no one could know how great the contrition ought to be
in order to be sufficient before God, they gave this consolation:
He who could not have contrition, at least ought to have attrition,
which I may call half a contrition or the beginning of contrition;
for they have themselves understood neither of these terms nor
do they understand them now, as little as I. Such attrition
was reckoned as contrition when a person went to confession.


{{< hiddenanchor 17 >}}17{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And when
it happened that any one said that he could not have contrition
nor lament his sins (as might have occurred in illicit love
or the desire for revenge, etc.), they asked whether he did
not wish or desire to have contrition [lament]. When one would
reply Yes (for who, save the devil himself, would here say No?),
they accepted this as contrition, and forgave him his sins on
account of this good work of his [which they adorned with the
name of contrition]. Here they cited the example of St. Bernard,
etc.

{{< hiddenanchor 18 >}}18{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Here we
see how blind reason, in matters pertaining to God, gropes about,
and, according to its own imagination, seeks for consolation
in its own works, and cannot think of [entirely forgets] Christ
and faith. But if it be [clearly] viewed in the light, this
contrition is a manufactured and fictitious thought [or imagination],
derived from man's own powers, without faith and without the
knowledge of Christ. And in it the poor sinner, when he reflected
upon his own lust and desire for revenge, would sometimes [perhaps]
have laughed rather than wept [either laughed or wept, rather
than to think of something else], except such as either had
been truly struck by [the lightning of] the Law, or had been
vainly vexed by the devil with a sorrowful spirit. Otherwise
[with the exception of these persons] such contrition was certainly
mere hypocrisy, and did not mortify the lust for sins [flames
of sin]; for they had to grieve, while they would rather have
continued to sin, if it had been free to them.

{{< hiddenanchor 19 >}}19{{< /hiddenanchor >}} As regards
confession, the procedure was this: Every one had [was enjoined]
to enumerate all his sins (which is an impossible thing). This
was a great torment. From such as he had forgotten [But if any
one had forgotten some sins] he would be absolved on the condition
that, if they would occur to him, he must still confess them.
In this way he could never know whether he had made a sufficiently
pure confession [perfectly and correctly], or when confessing
would ever have an end. Yet he was pointed to his own works,
and comforted thus: The more fully [sincerely and frankly] one
confesses, and the more he humiliates himself and debases himself
before the priest, the sooner and better he renders satisfaction
for his sins; for such humility certainly would earn grace before
God.

{{< hiddenanchor 20 >}}20{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Here,
too, there was no faith nor Christ, and the virtue of the absolution
was not declared to him, but upon his enumeration of sins and
his self-abasement depended his consolation. What torture, rascality,
and idolatry such confession has produced is more than can be
related.

{{< hiddenanchor 21 >}}21{{< /hiddenanchor >}} As to
satisfaction, this is by far the most involved [perplexing]
part of all. For no man could know how much to render for a
single sin, not to say how much for all. Here they have resorted
to the device of imposing a small satisfaction, which could
indeed be rendered, as five Paternosters, a day's fast, etc.;
for the rest [that was lacking] of the [in their] repentance
they were directed to purgatory.

{{< hiddenanchor 22 >}}22{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Here,
too, there was nothing but anguish and [extreme] misery. [For]
some thought that they would never get out of purgatory, because,
according to the old canons, seven years' repentance is required
for a single mortal sin. {{< hiddenanchor 23 >}}23{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Nevertheless, confidence
was placed upon our work of satisfaction, and if the satisfaction
could have been perfect, confidence would have been placed in
it entirely, and neither faith nor Christ would have been of
use. But this confidence was impossible. For, although any one
had done penance in that way for a hundred years, he would still
not have known whether he had finished his penance. That meant
forever to do penance and never to come to repentance.

{{< hiddenanchor 24 >}}24{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Here now
the Holy See at Rome, coming to the aid of the poor Church,
invented indulgences, whereby it forgave and remitted [expiation
or] satisfaction, first, for a single instance, for seven years,
for a hundred years and distributed them among the cardinals
and bishops, so that one could grant indulgence for a hundred
years and another for a hundred days. But he reserved to himself
alone the power to remit the entire satisfaction.

{{< hiddenanchor 25 >}}25{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Now, since
this began to yield money, and the traffic in bulls became profitable
he devised the golden jubilee year [a truly gold-bearing year],
and fixed it at Rome. He called this the remission of all punishment
and guilt. Then the people came running, because every one would
fain have been freed from this grievous, unbearable burden.
This meant to find [dig up] and raise the treasures of the earth.
Immediately the Pope pressed still further, and multiplied the
golden years one upon another. But the more he devoured money,
the wider grew his maw.

Later, therefore,
he issued them [those golden years of his] by his legates [everywhere]
to the countries, until all churches and houses were full of
the Golden Year. {{< hiddenanchor 26 >}}26{{< /hiddenanchor >}} At last he also made an inroad into
purgatory among the dead, first, by founding masses and vigils,
afterwards, by indulgences and the Golden Year, and finally
souls became so cheap that he released one for a farthing.

{{< hiddenanchor 27 >}}27{{< /hiddenanchor >}} But all
this, too, was of no avail. For although the Pope taught men
to depend upon, and trust in, these indulgences [for salvation],
yet he rendered the [whole] matter again uncertain. For in his
bulls he declares: Whoever would share in the indulgences or
a Golden Year must be contrite, and have confessed, and pay
money. Now, we have heard above that this contrition and confession
are with them uncertain and hypocrisy. Likewise, also no one
knew what soul was in purgatory, and if some were therein, no
one knew which had properly repented and confessed. Thus he
took the precious money [the Pope snatched up the holy pence],
and comforted them meanwhile with [led them to confidence in]
his power and indulgence, and [then again led them away from
that and] directed them again to their uncertain work.

{{< hiddenanchor 28 >}}28{{< /hiddenanchor >}} If, now
[although], there were some who did not believe [acknowledge]
themselves guilty of such actual sins in [committed by] thoughts,
words, and works,—as I, and such as I, in monasteries and
chapters [fraternities or colleges of priests], wished to be
monks and priests, and by fasting, watching, praying, saying
Mass, coarse garments, and hard beds, etc., fought against [strove
to resist] evil thoughts, and in full earnest and with force
wanted to be holy, and yet the hereditary, inborn evil sometimes
did in sleep what it is wont to do (as also St. Augustine and
Jerome among others confess),—still each one held the other
in esteem, so that some, according to our teaching, were regarded
as holy, without sin and full of good works, so much so that
with this mind we would communicate and sell our good works
to others, as being superfluous to us for heaven. This is indeed
true, and seals, letters, and instances [that this happened]
are at hand.

{{< hiddenanchor 29 >}}29{{< /hiddenanchor >}} [When
there were such, I say,] These did not need repentance. For
of what would they repent, since they had not indulged wicked
thoughts? What would they confess [concerning words not uttered],
since they had avoided words? For what should they render satisfaction,
since they were so guiltless of any deed that they could even
sell their superfluous righteousness to other poor sinners?
Such saints were also the Pharisees and scribes in the time
of Christ.

{{< hiddenanchor 30 >}}30{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Here comes
the fiery angel, St. John [Rev. {{< hiddenanchor 10 >}}10{{< /hiddenanchor >}}, the true preacher of [true]
repentance, and with one [thunderclap and] bolt hurls both [those
selling and those buying works] on one heap, and says: _Repent_!
Matt. 3:2. {{< hiddenanchor 31 >}}31{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Now, the former [the poor wretches] imagine:
Why, we have repented! The latter [the rest] say: We need no
repentance. {{< hiddenanchor 32 >}}32{{< /hiddenanchor >}} John says: Repent ye, both of you, for
ye are false penitents; so are these [the rest] false saints
[or hypocrites], and all of you on either side need the forgiveness
of sins, because neither of you know what true sin is not to
say anything about your duty to repent of it and shun it. For
no one of you is good; you are full of unbelief, stupidity,
and ignorance of God and God's will. For here He is present
_of whose fulness have all we received_, _and grace for
grace_, John 1:16, and without Him no man can be just before
God. Therefore, if you wish to repent, repent aright; your penance
will not accomplish anything [is nothing]. And you hypocrites,
who do not need repentance, you serpents' brood, who has assured
you that you will escape the wrath to come? etc. Matt. 3:7;
Luke 3:7.

{{< hiddenanchor 33 >}}33{{< /hiddenanchor >}} In the
same way Paul also preaches, Rom. 3:10-12: _There is none
righteous_, _there is none that understandeth_, _there
is none that seeketh after God_, _there is none that doeth
good_, _no not one; they are all gone out of the way; they
are together become unprofitable_. {{< hiddenanchor 34 >}}34{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And Acts 17:30: _God now commandeth all men everywhere to repent_.
"All men," he says; no one excepted who is a man. {{< hiddenanchor 35 >}}35{{< /hiddenanchor >}}
This repentance teaches us to discern sin, namely, that we are
altogether lost, and that there is nothing good in us from head
to foot [both within and without], and that we must absolutely
become new and other men.

{{< hiddenanchor 36 >}}36{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This repentance
is not piecemeal [partial] and beggarly [fragmentary], like
that which does penance for actual sins, nor is it uncertain
like that. For it does not debate what is or is not sin, but
hurls everything on a heap, and says: All in us is nothing but
sin [affirms that, with respect to us, all is simply sin (and
there is nothing in us that is not sin and guilt)]. What is
the use of [For why do we wish] investigating, dividing, or
distinguishing a long time? For this reason, too, this contrition
is not [doubtful or] uncertain. For there is nothing left with
which we can think of any good thing to pay for sin, but there
is only a sure despairing concerning all that we are, think,
speak, or do [all hope must be cast aside in respect of everything],
etc.

{{< hiddenanchor 37 >}}37{{< /hiddenanchor >}} In like
manner confession, too, cannot be false, uncertain, or piecemeal
[mutilated or fragmentary]. For he who confesses that all in
him is nothing but sin comprehends all sins, excludes none,
forgets none. {{< hiddenanchor 38 >}}38{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Neither can the satisfaction be uncertain,
because it is not our uncertain, sinful work, but it is the
suffering and blood of the [spotless and] innocent Lamb of God
who taketh away the sin of the world.

{{< hiddenanchor 39 >}}39{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Of this
repentance John preaches, and afterwards Christ in the Gospel,
and we also. By this [preaching of] repentance we dash to the
ground the Pope and everything that is built upon our good works.
For all is built upon a rotten and vain foundation, which is
called a good work or law, even though no good work is there,
but only wicked works, and no one does the Law (as Christ, John
7:19, says), but all transgress it. Therefore the building
[that is raised upon it] is nothing but falsehood and hypocrisy,
even [in the part] where it is most holy and beautiful.

{{< hiddenanchor 40 >}}40{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And in
Christians this repentance continues until death, because, through
the entire life it contends with sin remaining in the flesh,
as Paul, Rom. 7:14-25, [shows] testifies that he _wars with
the law in his members_, etc.; and that, not by his own powers,
but by the gift of the Holy Ghost that follows the remission
of sins. This gift daily cleanses and sweeps out the remaining
sins, and works so as to render man truly pure and holy.

{{< hiddenanchor 41 >}}41{{< /hiddenanchor >}} The Pope,
the theologians, the jurists, and every other man know nothing
of this [from their own reason], but it is a doctrine from heaven,
revealed through the Gospel, and must suffer to be called heresy
by the godless saints [or hypocrites].

{{< hiddenanchor 42 >}}42{{< /hiddenanchor >}} On the
other hand, if certain sectarists would arise, some of whom
are perhaps already extant, and in the time of the insurrection
[of the peasants] came to my own view, holding that all those
who had once received the Spirit or the forgiveness of sins,
or had become believers, even though they should afterwards
sin, would still remain in the faith, and such sin would not
harm them, and [hence] crying thus: "Do whatever you please;
if you believe, it all amounts to nothing; faith blots out all
sins," etc.—they say, besides, that if any one sins after
he has received faith and the Spirit, he never truly had the
Spirit and faith: I have had before me [seen and heard] many
such insane men, and I fear that in some such a devil is still
remaining [hiding and dwelling].

{{< hiddenanchor 43 >}}43{{< /hiddenanchor >}} It is,
accordingly, necessary to know and to teach that when holy men,
still having and feeling original sin, also daily repenting
of and striving with it, happen to fall into manifest sins,
as David into adultery, murder, and blasphemy, that then faith
and the Holy Ghost has departed from them [they cast out faith
and the Holy Ghost]. For the Holy Ghost does not permit sin
to have dominion, to gain the upper hand so as to be accomplished,
but represses and restrains it so that it must not do what it
wishes. But if it does what it wishes, the Holy Ghost and faith
are [certainly] not present. For St. John says, 1 John 3:9:
_Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin_, ... _and
he cannot sin_. And yet it is also the truth when the same
St. John says, 1:8: _If we say that we have no sin_, _we
deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us_.
