{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Of the
Sacrament of the Altar we hold that bread and wine in the Supper
are the true body and blood of Christ, and are given and received
not only by the godly, but also by wicked Christians.

{{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And that
not only one form is to be given. [For] we do not need that
high art [specious wisdom] which is to teach us that under the
one form there is as much as under both, as the sophists and
the Council of Constance teach. {{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For even if it were
true that there is as much under one as under both, yet the
one form only is not the entire ordinance and institution [made]
ordained and commanded by Christ. {{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And we especially
condemn and in God's name execrate those who not only omit both
forms but also quite autocratically [tyrannically] prohibit,
condemn, and blaspheme them as heresy, and so exalt themselves
against and above Christ, our Lord and God [opposing and placing
themselves ahead of Christ], etc.

{{< hiddenanchor 5 >}}5{{< /hiddenanchor >}} As regards
transubstantiation, we care nothing about the sophistical subtlety
by which they teach that bread and wine leave or lose their
own natural substance, and that there remain only the appearance
and color of bread, and not true bread. For it is in perfect
agreement with Holy Scriptures that there is, and remains, bread,
as Paul himself calls it, 1 Cor. 10:16: _The bread which
we break_. And 1 Cor. 11:28: _Let him so eat of that bread_.
