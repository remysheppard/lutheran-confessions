{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} The declaration
of the Papists that human traditions serve for the remission
of sins, or merit salvation, is [altogether] unchristian and
condemned, as Christ says Matt. 15:9: _In vain they do worship
Me_, _teaching for doctrines the commandments of men_.
{{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Again, Titus 1:14: _That turn from the truth_.
Again, when they declare that it is a mortal sin if one breaks
these ordinances [does not keep these statutes], this, too,
is not right.

{{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} These are
the articles on which I must stand, and, God willing, shall
stand even to my death; and I do not know how to change or to
yield anything in them. If any one wishes to yield anything,
let him do it at the peril of his conscience.

{{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Lastly,
there still remains the Pope's bag of impostures concerning
foolish and childish articles, as, the dedication of churches,
the baptism of bells, the baptism of the altarstone, and the
inviting of sponsors to these rites, who would make donations
towards them. Such baptizing is a reproach and mockery of Holy
Baptism, hence should not be tolerated. {{< hiddenanchor 5 >}}5{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Furthermore,
concerning the consecration of wax-tapers, palm-branches, cakes,
oats, [herbs,] spices, etc., which indeed, cannot be called
consecrations, but are sheer mockery and fraud. And such deceptions
there are without number, which we commend for adoration to
their god and to themselves, until they weary of it. We will
[ought to] have nothing to do with them.
