{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Here we
must confess, as Paul says in Rom. 5:12, that sin originated
[and entered the world] from one man Adam, by whose disobedience
all men were made sinners, [and] subject to death and the devil.
This is called original or capital sin.

{{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} The fruits
of this sin are afterwards the evil deeds which are forbidden
in the Ten Commandments, such as [distrust] unbelief, false
faith, idolatry, to be without the fear of God, presumption
[recklessness], despair, blindness [or complete _loss of sight_],
and, in short not to know or regard God; furthermore to lie,
to swear by [to abuse] God's name [to swear falsely], not to
pray, not to call upon God, not to regard [to despise or neglect]
God's Word, to be disobedient to parents, to murder, to be unchaste,
to steal, to deceive, etc.

{{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This hereditary
sin is so deep [and horrible] a corruption of nature that no
reason can understand it, but it must be [learned and] believed
from the revelation of Scriptures, Ps. 51:5; Rom. 6:12ff ;
Ex. 33:3; Gen. 3:7ff Hence, it is nothing but error and blindness
in regard to this article what the scholastic doctors have taught,
namely:

{{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} _That since
the fall of Adam the natural powers of man have remained entire
and incorrupt, and that man by nature has a right reason and
a good will; which things the philosophers teach._

{{< hiddenanchor 5 >}}5{{< /hiddenanchor >}} _Again,
that man has a free will to do good and omit evil, and, conversely,
to omit good and do evil._

{{< hiddenanchor 6 >}}6{{< /hiddenanchor >}} _Again,
that man by his natural powers can observe and keep [do] all
the commands of God._

{{< hiddenanchor 7 >}}7{{< /hiddenanchor >}} _Again,
that, by his natural powers, man can love God above all things
and his neighbor as himself._

{{< hiddenanchor 8 >}}8{{< /hiddenanchor >}} _Again,
if a man does as much as is in him, God certainly grants him
His grace._

{{< hiddenanchor 9 >}}9{{< /hiddenanchor >}} _Again,
if he wishes to go to the Sacrament, there is no need of a good
intention to do good, but it is sufficient if he has not a wicked
purpose to commit sin; so entirely good is his nature and so
efficacious the Sacrament._

{{< hiddenanchor 10 >}}10{{< /hiddenanchor >}} [Again,]
_that it is not founded upon Scripture that for a good work the
Holy Ghost with His grace is necessary._

{{< hiddenanchor 11 >}}11{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Such and
many similar things have arisen from want of understanding and
ignorance as regards both this sin and Christ, our Savior, and
they are truly heathen dogmas, which we cannot endure. For if
this teaching were right [approved], then Christ has died in
vain, since there is in man no defect nor sin for which he should
have died; or He would have died only for the body, not for
the soul, inasmuch as the soul is [entirely] sound, and the
body only is subject to death.
