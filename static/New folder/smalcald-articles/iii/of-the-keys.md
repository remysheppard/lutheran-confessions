{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} The keys
are an office and power given by Christ to the Church for binding
and loosing sin, not only the gross and well-known sins, but
also the subtle, hidden, which are known only to God, as it
is written in Ps. 19:13: _Who can understand his errors_?
And in Rom. 7:25 St. Paul himself complains _that with the
flesh he serves the law of sin_. {{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For it is not
in our power, but belongs to God alone, to judge which, how
great, and how many the sins are, as it is written in Ps. 143:2: _Enter not into judgment with Thy servant; for in Thy sight
shall no man living be justified_. {{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And Paul says,
1 Cor. 4:4: _For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby
justified_.
