{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} As monastic
vows directly conflict with the first chief article, they must
be absolutely abolished. For it is of them that Christ says,
Matt. 24:5,23ff : _I am Christ_, etc. {{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For he
who makes a vow to live as a monk believes that he will enter
upon a mode of life holier than ordinary Christians lead, and
wishes to earn heaven by his own works not only for himself,
but also for others; this is to deny Christ. {{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And they
boast from their St. Thomas that a monastic vow is equal to
Baptism. This is blasphemy [against God].
