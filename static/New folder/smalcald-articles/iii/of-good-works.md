#### How One is Justified before God, and of Good Works.

{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} What I
have hitherto and constantly taught concerning this I know not
how to change in the least, namely, that by faith, as St. Peter
says, we acquire a new and clean heart, and God will and does
account us entirely righteous and holy for the sake of Christ,
our Mediator. And although sin in the flesh has not yet been
altogether removed or become dead, yet He will not punish or
remember it.

{{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And such
faith, renewal, and forgiveness of sins is followed by good
works. And what there is still sinful or imperfect also in them
shall not be accounted as sin or defect, even [and that, too]
for Christ's sake; but the entire man, both as to his person
and his works, is to be called and to be righteous and holy
from pure grace and mercy, shed upon us [unfolded] and spread
over us in Christ. {{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Therefore we cannot boast of many
merits and works, if they are viewed apart from grace and mercy,
but as it is written, 1 Cor. 1:31: _He that glorieth_,
_let him glory in the Lord_, namely, that he has a gracious
God. For thus all is well. {{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} We say, besides, that if
good works do not follow, faith is false and not true.
