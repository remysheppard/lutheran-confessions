{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} If the
bishops would be true bishops [would rightly discharge their
office], and would devote themselves to the Church and the Gospel,
it might be granted to them for the sake of love and unity,
but not from necessity, to ordain and confirm us and our preachers;
omitting, however, all comedies and spectacular display [deceptions,
absurdities, and appearances] of unchristian [heathenish] parade
and pomp. {{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} But because they neither are, nor wish to
be, true bishops, but worldly lords and princes, who will neither
preach, nor teach, nor baptize, nor administer the Lord's Supper,
nor perform any work or office of the Church, and, moreover,
persecute and condemn those who discharge these functions, having
been called to do so, the Church ought not on their account
to remain without ministers [to be forsaken by or deprived of
ministers].

{{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Therefore,
as the ancient examples of the Church and the Fathers teach
us, we ourselves will and ought to ordain suitable persons to
this office; and, even according to their own laws, they have
not the right to forbid or prevent us. For their laws say that
those ordained even by heretics should be declared [truly] ordained
and stay ordained [and that such ordination must not be changed],
as St. Jerome writes of the Church at Alexandria, that at first
it was governed in common by priests and preachers, without
bishops.
