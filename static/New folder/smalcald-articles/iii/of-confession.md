{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Since Absolution
or the Power of the Keys is also an aid and consolation against
sin and a bad conscience, ordained by Christ [Himself] in the
Gospel, Confession or Absolution ought by no means to be abolished
in the Church, especially on account of [tender and] timid consciences
and on account of the untrained [and capricious] young people,
in order that they may be examined, and instructed in the Christian
doctrine.

{{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} But the
enumeration of sins ought to be free to every one, as to what
he wishes to enumerate or not to enumerate. For as long as we
are in the flesh, we shall not lie when we say: "I am a poor
man [I acknowledge that I am a miserable sinner], full of sin."
Rom. 7:23: _I see another law in my members_, etc. For
since private absolution originates in the Office of the Keys,
it should not be despised [neglected], but greatly and highly
esteemed [of the greatest worth], as [also] all other offices
of the Christian Church.

{{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And in
those things which concern the spoken, outward Word, we must
firmly hold that God grants His Spirit or grace to no one, except
through or with the preceding outward Word, in order that we
may [thus] be protected against the enthusiasts, _i.e_.,
spirits who boast that they have the Spirit without and before
the Word, and accordingly judge Scripture or the spoken Word,
and explain and stretch it at their pleasure, as Muenzer did,
and many still do at the present day, who wish to be acute judges
between the Spirit and the letter, and yet know not what they
say or declare. {{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For [indeed] the Papacy also is nothing
but sheer enthusiasm, by which the Pope boasts that all rights
exist in the shrine of his heart, and whatever he decides and
commands with [in] his church is spirit and right, even though
it is above and contrary to Scripture and the spoken Word.

{{< hiddenanchor 5 >}}5{{< /hiddenanchor >}} All this
is the old devil and old serpent, who also converted Adam and
Eve into enthusiasts, and led them from the outward Word of
God to spiritualizing and self-conceit, and nevertheless he
accomplished this through other outward words. {{< hiddenanchor 6 >}}6{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Just
as also our enthusiasts [at the present day] condemn the outward
Word, and nevertheless they themselves are not silent, but they
fill the world with their pratings and writings, as though,
indeed, the Spirit could not come through the writings and spoken
word of the apostles, but [first] through their writings and
words he must come. Why [then] do not they also omit their own
sermons and writings, until the Spirit Himself come to men,
without their writings and before them, as they boast that He
has come into them without the preaching of the Scriptures?
But of these matters there is not time now to dispute at greater
length; we have elsewhere sufficiently urged this subject.

{{< hiddenanchor 7 >}}7{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For even
those who believe before Baptism, or become believing in Baptism,
believe through the preceding outward Word, as the adults, who
have come to reason, must first have heard: _He that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved_, even though they are at
first unbelieving, and receive the Spirit and Baptism ten years
afterwards. {{< hiddenanchor 8 >}}8{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Cornelius, Acts 10:1ff , had heard long
before among the Jews of the coming Messiah, through whom he
was righteous before God, and in such faith his prayers and
alms were acceptable to God (as Luke calls him devout and God-fearing),
and without such preceding Word and hearing could not have believed
or been righteous. But St. Peter had to reveal to him that the
Messiah (in whom, as one that was to come, he had hitherto believed)
now had come, lest his faith concerning the coming Messiah hold
him captive among the hardened and unbelieving Jews, but know
that he was now to be saved by the present Messiah, and must
not, with the [rabble of the] Jews deny nor persecute Him.

{{< hiddenanchor 9 >}}9{{< /hiddenanchor >}} In a word,
enthusiasm inheres in Adam and his children from the beginning
[from the first fall] to the end of the world, [its poison]
having been implanted and infused into them by the old dragon,
and is the origin, power [life], and strength of all heresy,
especially of that of the Papacy and Mahomet. {{< hiddenanchor 10 >}}10{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Therefore
we ought and must constantly maintain this point, that God does
not wish to deal with us otherwise than through the spoken Word
and the Sacraments. {{< hiddenanchor 11 >}}11{{< /hiddenanchor >}} It is the devil himself whatsoever
is extolled as Spirit without the Word and Sacraments. For God
wished to appear even to Moses through the burning bush and
spoken Word; and no prophet neither Elijah nor Elisha, received
the Spirit without the Ten Commandments [or spoken Word]. {{< hiddenanchor 12 >}}12{{< /hiddenanchor >}}
Neither was John the Baptist conceived without the preceding
word of Gabriel, nor did he leap in his mother's womb without
the voice of Mary. {{< hiddenanchor 13 >}}13{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And Peter says, 2 Pet. 1:21:
_The prophecy came not by the will of man; but holy men of
God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost_. Without
the outward Word, however, they were not holy, much less would
the Holy Ghost have moved them to speak when they still were
unholy [or profane]; for they were holy, says he, since the
Holy Ghost spake through them.
