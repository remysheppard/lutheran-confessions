{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Here we
hold that the Law was given by God, first, to restrain sin by
threats and the dread of punishment, and by the promise and
offer of grace and benefit. But all this miscarried on account
of the wickedness which sin has wrought in man. {{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For
thereby a part [some] were rendered worse, those, namely, who
are hostile to [hate] the Law, because it forbids what they
like to do, and enjoins what they do not like to do. Therefore,
wherever they can escape [if they were not restrained by] punishment,
they [would] do more against the Law than before. These, then,
are the rude and wicked [unbridled and secure] men, who do evil
wherever they [notice that they] have the opportunity.

{{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} The rest
become blind and arrogant [are smitten with arrogance and blindness],
and [insolently] conceive the opinion that they observe and
can observe the Law by their own powers, as has been said above
concerning the scholastic theologians; thence come the hypocrites
and [self-righteous or] false saints.

{{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} But the
chief office or force of the Law is that it reveal original
sin with all its fruits, and show man how very low his nature
has fallen, and has become [fundamentally and] utterly corrupted;
as the Law must tell man that he has no God nor regards [cares
for] God, and worships other gods, a matter which before and
without the Law he would not have believed. In this way he becomes
terrified, is humbled, desponds, despairs, and anxiously desires
aid, but sees no escape; he begins to be an enemy of [enraged
at] God, and to murmur, etc. {{< hiddenanchor 5 >}}5{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This is what Paul says,
Rom. 4:15: _The Law worketh wrath_. And Rom. 5:20: _Sin
is increased by the Law_. [ _The Law entered that the offense
might abound_.]
