The greater excommunication,
as the Pope calls it, we regard only as a civil penalty, and
it does not concern us ministers of the Church. But the lesser,
that is, the true Christian excommunication, consists in this,
that manifest and obstinate sinners are not admitted to the
Sacrament and other communion of the Church until they amend
their lives and avoid sin. And ministers ought not to mingle
secular punishments with this ecclesiastical punishment, or
excommunication.
