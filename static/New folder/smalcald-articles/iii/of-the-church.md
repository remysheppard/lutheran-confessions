{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} We do not
concede to them that they are the Church, and [in truth] they
are not [the Church]; nor will we listen to those things which,
under the name of Church, they enjoin or forbid. {{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For,
thank God, [to-day] a child seven years old knows what the Church
is, namely, the holy believers and lambs who hear the voice
of their Shepherd. For the children pray thus: _I believe in
one holy_ [catholic or] _Christian Church_. {{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This holiness
does not consist in albs, tonsures, long gowns, and other of
their ceremonies devised by them beyond Holy Scripture, but
in the Word of God and true faith.
