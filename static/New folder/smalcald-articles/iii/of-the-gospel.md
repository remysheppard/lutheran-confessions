We will now return
to the Gospel, which not merely in one way gives us counsel
and aid against sin; for God is superabundantly rich [and liberal]
in His grace [and goodness]. First, through the spoken Word
by which the forgiveness of sins is preached [He commands to
be preached] in the whole world; which is the peculiar office
of the Gospel. Secondly, through Baptism. Thirdly, through the
holy Sacrament of the Altar. Fourthly, through the power of
the keys, and also through the mutual conversation and consolation
of brethren, Matt. 18:20: _Where two or three are gathered
together_, etc.
