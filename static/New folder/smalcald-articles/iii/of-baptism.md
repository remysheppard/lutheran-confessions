{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Baptism
is nothing else than the Word of God in the water, commanded
by His institution, or, as Paul says, _a washing in the Word_;
as also Augustine says: _Let the Word come to the element_,
_and it becomes a Sacrament_. {{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And for this reason
we do not hold with Thomas and the monastic preachers [or Dominicans]
who forget the Word (God's institution) and say that God has
imparted to the water a spiritual power, which through the water
washes away sin. {{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Nor [do we agree] with Scotus and
the Barefooted monks [Minorites or Franciscan monks], who teach
that, by the assistance of the divine will, Baptism washes away
sins, and that this ablution occurs only through the will of
God, and by no means through the Word or water.

{{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Of the
baptism of children we hold that children ought to be baptized.
For they belong to the promised redemption made through Christ,
and the Church should administer it [Baptism and the announcement
of that promise] to them.
