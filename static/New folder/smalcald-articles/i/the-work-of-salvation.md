IV.  _That the Son became man in this manner_, _that He was conceived_, _without
the cooperation of man_, _by the Holy Ghost_, _and
was born of the pure_, _holy_ [ _and always_] _Virgin
Mary. Afterwards He suffered_, _died_, _was buried_,
_descended to hell_, _rose from the dead_, _ascended
to heaven_, _sits at the right hand of God_, _will
come to judge the quick and the dead_, _etc._, _as
the Creed of the Apostles_, _as well as that of St. Athanasius_,
_and the Catechism in common use for children_, _teach._

Concerning these articles there is no contention or dispute, since we on both
sides confess them. Therefore it is not necessary now to treat
further of them.
