{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} That the
Mass in the Papacy must be the greatest and most horrible abomination,
as it directly and powerfully conflicts with this chief article,
and yet above and before all other popish idolatries it has
been the chief and most specious. For it has been held that
this sacrifice or work of the Mass, even though it be rendered
by a wicked [and abandoned] scoundrel, frees men from sins,
both in this life and also in purgatory, while only the Lamb
of God shall and must do this, as has been said above. Of this
article nothing is to be surrendered or conceded, because the
first article does not allow it.

{{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} If, perchance,
there were reasonable Papists we might speak moderately and
in a friendly way, thus: first, why they so rigidly uphold the
Mass. For it is but a pure invention of men, and has not been
commanded by God; and every invention of man we may [safely]
discard, as Christ declares, Matt. 15:9: _In vain do they
worship Me_, _teaching for doctrines the commandments of
men_.

{{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Secondly.
It is an unnecessary thing, which can be omitted without sin
and danger.

{{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Thirdly.
The Sacrament can be received in a better and more blessed way
[more acceptable to God], (yea, the only blessed way), according
to the institution of Christ. Why, then, do they drive the world
to woe and [extreme] misery on account of a fictitious, unnecessary
matter, which can be well obtained in another and more blessed
way?

{{< hiddenanchor 5 >}}5{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Let [care
be taken that] it be publicly preached to the people that the
Mass as men's twaddle [commentitious affair or human figment]
can be omitted without sin, and that no one will be condemned
who does not observe it, but that he can be saved in a better
way without the Mass. I wager [Thus it will come to pass] that
the Mass will then collapse of itself, not only among the insane
[rude] common people, but also among all pious, Christian, reasonable,
God-fearing hearts; and that the more, when they would hear
that the Mass is a [very] dangerous thing, fabricated and invented
without the will and Word of God.

{{< hiddenanchor 6 >}}6{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Fourthly.
Since such innumerable and unspeakable abuses have arisen in
the whole world from the buying and selling of masses, the Mass
should by right be relinquished, if for no other purpose than
to prevent abuses, even though in itself it had something advantageous
and good. How much more ought we to relinquish it, so as to
prevent [escape] forever these horrible abuses, since it is
altogether unnecessary, useless, and dangerous, and we can obtain
everything by a more necessary, profitable, and certain way
without the Mass.

{{< hiddenanchor 7 >}}7{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Fifthly.
But since the Mass is nothing else and can be nothing else (as
the Canon and all books declare), than a work of men (even of
wicked scoundrels), by which one attempts to reconcile himself
and others to God, and to obtain and merit the remission of
sins and grace (for thus the Mass is observed when it is observed
at the very best; otherwise what purpose would it serve?), for
this very reason it must and should [certainly] be condemned
and rejected. For this directly conflicts with the chief article,
which says that it is not a wicked or a godly hireling of the
Mass with his own work, but the Lamb of God and the Son of God,
that taketh away our sins.

{{< hiddenanchor 8 >}}8{{< /hiddenanchor >}} But if
any one should advance the pretext that as an act of devotion
he wishes to administer the Sacrament, or Communion, to himself,
he is not in earnest [he would commit a great mistake, and would
not be speaking seriously and sincerely]. For if he wishes to
commune in sincerity, the surest and best way for him is in
the Sacrament administered according to Christ's institution.
But that one administer communion to himself is a human notion,
uncertain, unnecessary, yea, even prohibited. And he does not
know what he is doing, because without the Word of God he obeys
a false human opinion and invention. {{< hiddenanchor 9 >}}9{{< /hiddenanchor >}} So, too, it is
not right (even though the matter were otherwise correct) for
one to use the common Sacrament of [belonging to] the Church
according to his own private devotion, and without God's Word
and apart from the communion of the Church to trifle therewith.


{{< hiddenanchor 10 >}}10{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This article
concerning the Mass will be the whole business of the Council.
[The Council will perspire most over, and be occupied with this
article concerning the Mass.] For if it were [although it would
be] possible for them to concede to us all the other articles,
yet they could not concede this. As Campegius said at Augsburg
that he would be torn to pieces before he would relinquish the
Mass, so, by the help of God, I, too, would suffer myself to
be reduced to ashes before I would allow a hireling of the Mass,
be he good or bad, to be made equal to Christ Jesus, my Lord
and Savior, or to be exalted above Him. Thus we are and remain
eternally separated and opposed to one another. They feel well
enough that when the Mass falls, the Papacy lies in ruins. Before
they will permit this to occur, they will put us all to death
if they can.

{{< hiddenanchor 11 >}}11{{< /hiddenanchor >}} _In addition
to all this, this dragon's tail, [I mean] the Mass, has begotten
a numerous vermin-brood of manifold idolatries._

{{< hiddenanchor 12 >}}12{{< /hiddenanchor >}} First,
purgatory. Here they carried their trade into purgatory by masses
for souls, and vigils, and weekly, monthly, and yearly celebrations
of obsequies, and finally by the Common Week and All Souls' Day,
by soul-baths so that the Mass is used almost alone for the
dead, although Christ has instituted the Sacrament alone for
the living. Therefore purgatory, and every solemnity, rite,
and commerce connected with it, is to be regarded as nothing
but a specter of the devil. For it conflicts with the chief
article [which teaches] that only Christ, and not the works
of men, are to help [set free] souls. Not to mention the fact
that nothing has been [divinely] commanded or enjoined upon
us concerning the dead. Therefore all this may be safely omitted,
even if it were no error and idolatry.

{{< hiddenanchor 13 >}}13{{< /hiddenanchor >}} The Papists
quote here Augustine and some of the Fathers who are said to
have written concerning purgatory, and they think that we do
not understand for what purpose and to what end they spoke as
they did. St. Augustine does not write that there is a purgatory,
nor has he a testimony of Scripture to constrain him thereto,
but he leaves it in doubt whether there is one, and says that
his mother asked to be remembered at the altar or Sacrament.
Now, all this is indeed nothing but the devotion of men, and
that, too, of individuals, and does not establish an article
of faith, which is the prerogative of God alone.

{{< hiddenanchor 14 >}}14{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Our Papists,
however, cite such statements [opinions] of men in order that
men should believe in their horrible, blasphemous, and cursed
traffic in masses for souls in purgatory [or in sacrifices for
the dead and oblations], etc. But they will never prove these
things from Augustine. Now, when they have abolished the traffic
in masses for purgatory, of which Augustine never dreamt, we
will then discuss with them whether the expressions of Augustine
without Scripture [being without the warrant of the Word] are
to be admitted, and whether the dead should be remembered at
the Eucharist. {{< hiddenanchor 15 >}}15{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For it will not do to frame articles
of faith from the works or words of the holy Fathers; otherwise
their kind of fare, of garments, of house, etc., would have
to become an article of faith, as was done with relics. [We
have, however, another rule, namely] The rule is: The Word of
God shall establish articles of faith, and no one else, not
even an angel.

{{< hiddenanchor 16 >}}16{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Secondly.
From this it has followed that evil spirits have perpetrated
much knavery [exercised their malice] by appearing as the souls
of the departed, and with unspeakable [horrible] lies and tricks
demanded masses, vigils, pilgrimages, and other alms. {{< hiddenanchor 17 >}}17{{< /hiddenanchor >}}
All of which we had to receive as articles of faith, and to
live accordingly; and the Pope confirmed these things, as also
the Mass and all other abominations. Here, too, there is no
[cannot and must not be any] yielding or surrendering.

{{< hiddenanchor 18 >}}18{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Thirdly.
[Hence arose] the pilgrimages. Here, too, masses, the remission
of sins and the grace of God were sought, for the Mass controlled
everything. Now it is indeed certain that such pilgrimages,
without the Word of God, have not been commanded us, neither
are they necessary, since we can have these things [the soul
can be cared for] in a better way, and can omit these pilgrimages
without any sin and danger. Why therefore do they leave at home
[desert] their own parish [their called ministers, their parishes],
the Word of God, wives, children, etc., who are ordained and
[attention to whom is necessary and has been] commanded, and
run after these unnecessary, uncertain, pernicious will-o'-the-wisps
of the devil [and errors]? {{< hiddenanchor 19 >}}19{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Unless the devil was riding
[made insane] the Pope, causing him to praise and establish
these practices, whereby the people again and again revolted
from Christ to their own works, and became idolaters, which
is worst of all; moreover, it is neither necessary nor commanded,
but is senseless and doubtful, and besides harmful. Hence here,
too, there can be no yielding or surrendering [to yield or concede
anything here is not lawful], etc. {{< hiddenanchor 20 >}}20{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And let this be
preached, that such pilgrimages are not necessary, but dangerous;
and then see what will become of them. [For thus they will perish
of their own accord.]

{{< hiddenanchor 21 >}}21{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Fourthly.
Fraternities [or societies], in which cloisters, chapters, vicars
have assigned and communicated (by a legal contract and sale)
all masses and good works, etc., both for the living and the
dead. This is not only altogether a human bauble, without the
Word of God, entirely unnecessary and not commanded, but also
contrary to the chief article, Of Redemption. Therefore it is
in no way to be tolerated.

{{< hiddenanchor 22 >}}22{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Fifthly.
The relics, in which there are found so many falsehoods and
tomfooleries concerning the bones of dogs and horses, that even
the devil has laughed at such rascalities, ought long ago to
have been condemned, even though there were some good in them;
and so much the more because they are without the Word of God;
being neither commanded nor counseled, they are an entirely
unnecessary and useless thing. {{< hiddenanchor 23 >}}23{{< /hiddenanchor >}} But the worst is that
[they have imagined that] these relics had to work indulgence
and the forgiveness of sins [and have revered them] as a good
work and service of God, like the Mass, etc.

{{< hiddenanchor 24 >}}24{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Sixthly.
Here belong the precious indulgences granted (but only for money)
both to the living and the dead, by which the miserable [sacrilegious
and accursed] Judas, or Pope, has sold the merit of Christ,
together with the superfluous merits of all saints and of the
entire Church, etc. All these things [and every single one of
them] are not to be borne, and are not only without the Word
of God, without necessity, not commanded, but are against the
chief article. For the merit of Christ is [apprehended and]
obtained not by our works or pence, but from grace through faith,
without money and merit; and is offered [and presented] not
through the power of the Pope, but through the preaching of
God's Word.

## _Of the Invocation of Saints_.

{{< hiddenanchor 25 >}}25{{< /hiddenanchor >}} The invocation
of saints is also one of the abuses of Antichrist conflicting
with the chief article, and destroys the knowledge of Christ.
Neither is it commanded nor counseled, nor has it any example
[or testimony] in Scripture, and even though it were a precious
thing, as it is not [while, on the contrary, it is a most harmful
thing], in Christ we have everything a thousandfold better [and
surer, so that we are not in need of calling upon the saints].


{{< hiddenanchor 26 >}}26{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And although
the angels in heaven pray for us (as Christ Himself also does),
as also do the saints on earth, and perhaps also in heaven,
yet it does not follow thence that we should invoke and adore
the angels and saints, and fast, hold festivals, celebrate Mass
in their honor, make offerings, and establish churches, altars,
divine worship, and in still other ways serve them, and regard
them as helpers in need [as patrons and intercessors], and divide
among them all kinds of help, and ascribe to each one a particular
form of assistance, as the Papists teach and do. For this is
idolatry, and such honor belongs alone to God. {{< hiddenanchor 27 >}}27{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For
as a Christian and saint upon earth you can pray for me, not
only in one, but in many necessities. But for this reason I
am not obliged to adore and invoke you, and celebrate festivals,
fast, make oblations, hold masses for your honor [and worship],
and put my faith in you for my salvation. I can in other ways
indeed honor, love, and thank you in Christ. {{< hiddenanchor 28 >}}28{{< /hiddenanchor >}} If now
such idolatrous honor were withdrawn from angels and departed
saints, the remaining honor would be without harm and would
quickly be forgotten. For when advantage and assistance, both
bodily and spiritual, are no more to be expected, the saints
will not be troubled [the worship of the saints will soon vanish],
neither in their graves nor in heaven. For without a reward
or out of pure love no one will much remember, or esteem, or
honor them [bestow on them divine honor].

{{< hiddenanchor 29 >}}29{{< /hiddenanchor >}} In short,
the Mass itself and anything that proceeds from it, and anything
that is attached to it, we cannot tolerate, but must condemn,
in order that we may retain the holy Sacrament pure and certain,
according to the institution of Christ, employed and received
through faith.
