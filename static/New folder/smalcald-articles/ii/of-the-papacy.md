{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} That
_the Pope is not, according to divine law or according to the Word
of God the head of all Christendom_ (for this [name] belongs
to One only, whose name is Jesus Christ), but is only the bishop
and pastor of the Church at Rome, and of those who voluntarily
or through a human creature (that is, a political magistrate)
have attached themselves to him, to be Christians, not under
him as a lord, but with him as brethren [colleagues] and comrades,
as the ancient councils and the age of St. Cyprian show.

{{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} But to-day
none of the bishops dare to address the Pope as brother as was
done at that time [in the age of Cyprian]; but they must call
him most gracious lord, even though they be kings or emperors.
This [Such arrogance] we will not, cannot, must not take upon
our conscience [with a good conscience approve]. Let him, however,
who will do it, do so without us [at his own risk].

{{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Hence it
follows that all things which the Pope, from a power so false,
mischievous, blasphemous, and arrogant, has done and undertaken.
have been and still are purely diabolical affairs and transactions
(with the exception of such things as pertain to the secular
government, where God often permits much good to be effected
for a people, even through a tyrant and [faithless] scoundrel)
for the ruin of the entire holy [catholic or] Christian Church
(so far as it is in his power) and for the destruction of the
first and chief article concerning the redemption made through
Jesus Christ.

{{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For all
his bulls and books are extant, in which he roars like a lion
(as the angel in Rev. 12 depicts him, [crying out] that no Christian
can be saved unless he obeys him and is subject to him in all
things that he wishes, that he says, and that he does. All of
which amounts to nothing less than saying: Although you believe
in Christ, and have in Him [alone] everything that is necessary
to salvation, yet it is nothing and all in vain unless you regard
[have and worship] me as your god, and be subject and obedient
to me. And yet it is manifest that the holy Church has been
without the Pope for at least more than five hundred years,
and that even to the present day the churches of the Greeks
and of many other languages neither have been nor are yet under
the Pope. {{< hiddenanchor 5 >}}5{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Besides, as often remarked, it is a human
figment which is not commanded, and is unnecessary and useless;
for the holy Christian [or catholic] Church can exist very well
without such a head, and it would certainly have remained better
[purer, and its career would have been more prosperous] if such
a head had not been raised up by the devil. {{< hiddenanchor 6 >}}6{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And the
Papacy is also of no use in the Church, because it exercises
no Christian office; and therefore it is necessary for the Church
to continue and to exist without the Pope.

{{< hiddenanchor 7 >}}7{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And supposing
that the Pope would yield this point, so as not to be supreme
by divine right or from God's command, but that we must have
[there must be elected] a [certain] head, to whom all the rest
adhere [as their support] in order that the [concord and] unity
of Christians may be preserved against sects and heretics, and
that such a head were chosen by men, and that it were placed
within the choice and power of men to change or remove this
head, just as the Council of Constance adopted nearly this course
with reference to the Popes, deposing three and electing a fourth;
supposing, I say, that the Pope and See at Rome would yield
and accept this (which, nevertheless, is impossible; for thus
he would have to suffer his entire realm and estate to be overthrown
and destroyed, with all his rights and books, a thing which,
to speak in few words, he cannot do), nevertheless, even in
this way Christianity would not be helped, but many more sects
would arise than before.

{{< hiddenanchor 8 >}}8{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For since
men would have to be subject to this head, not from God's command,
but from their personal good pleasure, it would easily and in
a short time be despised, and at last retain no member; neither
would it have to be forever confined to Rome or any other place,
but it might be wherever and in whatever church God would grant
a man fit for the [taking upon him such a great] office. Oh,
the complicated and confused state of affairs [perplexity] that
would result!

{{< hiddenanchor 9 >}}9{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Therefore
the Church can never be better governed and preserved than if
we all live under one head, Christ, and all the bishops equal
in office (although they be unequal in gifts), be diligently
joined in unity of doctrine, faith, Sacraments, prayer, and
works of love, etc., as St. Jerome writes that the priests at
Alexandria together and in common governed the churches, as
did also the apostles, and afterwards all bishops throughout
all Christendom, until the Pope raised his head above all.

{{< hiddenanchor 10 >}}10{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This teaching
shows forcefully that the Pope is the very Antichrist, who has
exalted himself above, and opposed himself against Christ because
he will not permit Christians to be saved without his power,
which, nevertheless, is nothing, and is neither ordained nor
commanded by God. {{< hiddenanchor 11 >}}11{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This is, properly speaking to _exalt
himself above all that is called God_ as Paul says, 2 Thess.
2:4. Even the Turks or the Tartars, great enemies of Christians
as they are, do not do this, but they allow whoever wishes to
believe in Christ, and take bodily tribute and obedience from
Christians.

{{< hiddenanchor 12 >}}12{{< /hiddenanchor >}} The Pope,
however, prohibits this faith, saying that to be saved a person
must obey him. This we are unwilling to do, even though on this
account we must die in God s name. {{< hiddenanchor 13 >}}13{{< /hiddenanchor >}} This all proceeds
from the fact that the Pope has wished to be called the supreme
head of the Christian Church by divine right. Accordingly he
had to make himself equal and superior to Christ, and had to
cause himself to be proclaimed the head and then the lord of
the Church, and finally of the whole world, and simply God on
earth, until he has dared to issue commands even to the angels
in heaven. {{< hiddenanchor 14 >}}14{{< /hiddenanchor >}} And when we distinguish the Pope's teaching
from, or measure and hold it against, Holy Scripture, it is
found [it appears plainly] that the Pope's teaching, where it
is best, has been taken from the imperial and heathen law, and
treats of political matters and decisions or rights, as the
Decretals show; furthermore, it teaches of ceremonies concerning
churches, garments, food, persons and [similar] puerile, theatrical
and comical things without measure, but in all these things
nothing at all of Christ, faith, and the commandments of God.
Lastly, it is nothing else than the devil himself, because above
and against God he urges [and disseminates] his [papal] falsehoods
concerning masses, purgatory, the monastic life, one's own works
and [fictitious] divine worship (for this is the very Papacy
[upon each of which the Papacy is altogether founded and is
standing]), and condemns, murders and tortures all Christians
who do not exalt and honor these abominations [of the Pope]
above all things. Therefore, just as little as we can worship
the devil himself as Lord and God, we can endure his apostle,
the Pope, or Antichrist, in his rule as head or lord. For to
lie and to kill, and to destroy body and soul eternally, that
is wherein his papal government really consists, as I have very
clearly shown in many books.

{{< hiddenanchor 15 >}}15{{< /hiddenanchor >}} In these
four articles they will have enough to condemn in the Council.
For they cannot and will not concede us even the least point
in one of these articles. Of this we should be certain, and
animate ourselves with [be forewarned and made firm in] the
hope that Christ, our Lord, has attacked His adversary, and
he will press the attack home [pursue and destroy him] both
by His Spirit and coming. Amen.

{{< hiddenanchor 16 >}}16{{< /hiddenanchor >}} For in
the Council we will stand not before the Emperor or the political
magistrate, as at Augsburg (where the Emperor published a most
gracious edict, and caused matters to be heard kindly [and dispassionately]),
but [we will appear] before the Pope and devil himself, who
intends to listen to nothing, but merely [when the case has
been publicly announced] to condemn, to murder and to force
us to idolatry. Therefore we ought not here to kiss his feet,
or to say: "Thou art my gracious lord", but as the angel in Zechariah
3:2 said to Satan: _The Lord rebuke thee_, _O Satan_.
