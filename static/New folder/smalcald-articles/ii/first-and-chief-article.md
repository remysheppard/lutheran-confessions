{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} _That
Jesus Christ_, _our God and Lord_, _died for our sins_,
_and was raised again for our justification_, Rom. 4:25.


{{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} _And
He alone is the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the
world_, _John 1:29; and God has laid upon Him the iniquities
of us all_, Is. 53:6.

{{< hiddenanchor 3 >}}3{{< /hiddenanchor >}} _Likewise:
All have sinned and are justified without merit_ [ _freely_,
_and without their own works or merits_] _by His grace_,
_through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus_, _in
His blood_, Rom. 3:23f

{{< hiddenanchor 4 >}}4{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Now, since
it is necessary to believe this, and it cannot be otherwise
acquired or apprehended by any work, law, or merit, it is clear
and certain that this faith alone justifies us as St. Paul says,
Rom. 3:28: _For we conclude that a man is justified by faith_,
_without the deeds of the Law_. Likewise 3:26: _That
He might be just_, _and the Justifier of him which believeth
in Christ._

{{< hiddenanchor 5 >}}5{{< /hiddenanchor >}} Of this
article nothing can be yielded or surrendered [nor can anything
be granted or permitted contrary to the same], even though heaven
and earth, and whatever will not abide, should sink to ruin.
_For there is none other name under heaven_, _given among
men whereby we must be saved_, says Peter, Acts 4:12. _And
with His stripes we are healed_, Is. 53:5. And upon this
article all things depend which we teach and practice in opposition
to the Pope, the devil, and the [whole] world. Therefore, we
must be sure concerning this doctrine, and not doubt; for otherwise
all is lost, and the Pope and devil and all things gain the
victory and suit over us.
