{{< hiddenanchor 1 >}}1{{< /hiddenanchor >}} That _chapters_
and _cloisters_ [colleges of canons and communistic dwellings],
which were formerly founded with the good intention [of our
forefathers] to educate learned men and chaste [and modest]
women, ought again to be turned to such use, in order that pastors,
preachers, and other ministers of the churches may be had, and
likewise other necessary persons [fitted] for [the political
administration of] the secular government [or for the commonwealth]
in cities and countries, and well-educated, maidens for mothers
and housekeepers, etc.

{{< hiddenanchor 2 >}}2{{< /hiddenanchor >}} If they
will not serve this purpose, it is better that they be abandoned
or razed, rather than [continued and], with their blasphemous
services invented by men, regarded as something better than
the ordinary Christian life and the offices and callings ordained
by God. For all this also is contrary to the first chief article
concerning the redemption made through Jesus Christ. Add to
this that (like all other human inventions) these have neither
been commanded; they are needless and useless, and, besides,
afford occasion for dangerous and vain labor [dangerous annoyances
and fruitless worship], such services as the prophets call _Aven_,
_i.e_., pain and labor.
