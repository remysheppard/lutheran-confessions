#### 136.Contents of the Leipzig Interim.

To exhibit the insidious character of the Leipzig
Interim more fully,we submit the following quotations.
In its Introduction we read:"As far as the doctrine of the
state and nature of man before and after the Fall is concerned,
there is no controversy"(between the Lutherans
and Romanists) . The article "Of Justification," in which
the Lutheran sola fide is omitted, declares: "The merciful
God does not work with man as with a block, but
draws him, so that his will also cooperates if he be of
understanding years." Again: "And they who have thus
received the forgiveness of sins and the Holy Ghost, and
in whom the Holy Ghost begins faith and trust in the
Son of God, love and hope, then become heirs of eternal
salvation for the Savior's sake." In the article "Of
Good Works" we read: "Nevertheless, the new virtues
and good works are so highly necessary that, if they
were not quickened in the heart there would be no
reception of divine grace." Again: "It is certainly true
that these virtues, faith, love, hope, and others,must be
in us and are necessary to salvation.... And since the
virtues and good works, as has been said, please God,
they merit also a reward in this life, both spiritual and
temporal, according to God's counsel, and still more
reward in the eternal life, because of the divine promise."

The article "Of Ecclesiastical Power" runs as follows:
"What the true Christian Church gathered in the
Holy Ghost, acknowledges, determines, and teaches in
regard to matters of faith is to be taught and preached,
since it neither should nor can determine anything contrary
to the Holy Scriptures." Self-evidently, Romanists
construed this as an a priori endorsement of the
Council and its resolutions. In the article "Of
Ecclesiastical Ministers" we read: "And that all other
ministers should be subject and obedient to the chief
bishop [the Pope] and to other bishops who administer
their episcopal office according to God's command,
using the same for edification and not for destruction;
which ministers should be ordained also by such bishops
upon presentation by the patrons."This article conceded
the primacy of the Pope and the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction of the bishops. The article "Of Ordination"
declares: "Also, that, as has been said, upon presentation
by patrons, ministers should hereafter be ordained with
Christian ceremonies by such bishops as administer
their episcopal office, and that no one should be allowed
to be in the ministry unless, as has been said, he be presented
by the patrons and have the permission of the
bishops." That was tantamount to a restoration of the
"sacrament" of episcopal ordination.

The Interim furthermore demanded the immediate
reintroduction of abolished ceremonies, such as
exorcism and other ceremonies of Baptism, confirmation
by bishops, auricular confession, extreme unction,
episcopal ordination, and the like. We read: "That
repentance, confession, and absolution, and what pertains
thereto, be diligently taught and preached; that the
people confess to the priests, and receive of them absolution
in God's stead, and be also diligently admonished
and urged to prayer, fasting, and almsgiving; also, that
no one be admitted to the highly venerable Sacrament
of the body and blood of Christ [in this indirect way
only the cup of the laity is referred to in the Interim]
unless he have first confessed to the priest and received
of him absolution."Again:"Although in this country the
unction [Extreme Unction] has not been in use for
many years, yet ... such unction, according to the apostle,
may be hereafter observed."Again:"That henceforth
the mass be observed in this country with ringing of
bells,with lights and vessels,with chants, vestments,and
ceremonies." Among the holidays to be observed the
Interim mentions also Corpus Christi and the festivals
of the holy Virgin Mary. Again we read: "The images
and pictures of the sufferings of Christ and of the saints
may be also retained in the churches." Again: "In the
churches where the canonical hours have been formerly
observed, the devout Psalms shall be sung in chapters
and towns at the appointed time and on other high festivals,
and also on Sundays." "Likewise, that on Fridays
and Saturdays, as well as during fasts, the eating of meat
be abstained from and that this be observed as an external;
ordinance at the command of His Imperial
Majesty." The clause, "that this be observed," etc., was
regarded by Flacius and Gallus as implying self-deception
and hypocrisy on the part of the Interimists. (Frank
4 72. 119.) Again, as to the apparel of priests, that "a distinction
be observed between ministers and secular persons,
and that proper reverence be paid the priestly
estate."The Introduction of the Interim gives the assurance
that the Lutherans would obey the Emperor and
be found disposed toward peace and unity. The
Conclusion adds the humble promise:"In all other articles
we are ready ... in a friendly and submissive manner
to confer with Your Beloved and Princely Graces, and to
settle our differences in a Christian way." (C R. 7, 258.
Jacobs, Book of Concord, 2, 260.)

#### 137. Issue in Adiaphoristic Controversy.

From the passages quoted it appears that the
Leipzig Interim was inoculated with the germs of many
controversies.However, while in the beginning its offensive
doctrinal features were not fully and generally recognized
and realized, the Emperor's demand for, and
approval of, the Wittenberg and Leipzig theologian's
reintroduction of the Romish ceremonies immediately
created an acute situation and a great commotion
everywhere. The resulting theological conflict pertaining
to the latter point in particular was called the
Adiaphoristic or Interimistic Controversy. And, as
explained above, even after the Interim had become a
dead letter politically, this controversy did not subside,
because its paramount object was not merely to pass a
correct judgment on past events during the Interim, nor
even to obtain norms for similar situations in the future,
but,above all, to eliminate from our Church the spirit of
indifferentism, unionism, and of direct as well as indirect
denial of the Gospel-truth.

Accordingly, the exact issue in the Adiaphoristic
Controversy was: May Lutherans, under conditions
such as prevailed during the Interim, when the
Romanists on pain of persecution and violence
demanded the reinstitution of abolished papal ceremonies,
even if the ceremonies in question be truly
indifferent in themselves, submit with a good conscience,
that is to say, without denying the truth and
Christian liberty, without sanctioning the errors of
Romanism, and without giving offense either to the
enemies or to the friends of the Lutheran Church, especially
its weak members? This was affirmed by the
Interimists and denied by their opponents.

#### 138. Opposition to the Adiaphorists.

Prominent among the theologians who participated
in the controversy against the Adiaphorists were
Flacius,Wigand, Gallus, and others,who in Magdeburg
opened a most effective fire on the authors, sponsors,
and advocates of the Interim. Following are some of the
chief publications which dealt with the questions
involved: "Opinion concerning the Interim, by
Melanchthon, June 16, 1548," published by Flacius
without the knowledge of Melanchthon.-"Report on
the Interim by the Theologians of Meissen," 1548.-
"That in These Dangerous Times (in diesen
geschwinden Laeuften) Nothing is to be Changed in the
Churches of God in Order to Please the Devil and the
Antichrist," by John Hermann, 1548. A Latin edition of
this publication appeared 1549, mentioning Flacius as
its author.-"A Brief Report (Ein kurzer Bericht) on the
Interim from which One may Easily Learn the Doctrine
and Spirit of That Book," 1548.-"A General Protest
and Writ of Complaint (Eine gemeine Protestation und
Klageschrift) of All Pious Christians against the Interim
and Other Sinister Schemes and Cruel Persecutions by
the Enemies of the Gospel, by John Waremund, 1548."
Waremund was a pseudonym for Flacius.-"Against
the Interim, Papal Mass, Canon, and Master Eisleben,"
1519.-"Against the Vile Devil (Wider den schnoeden
Teufel), who Now Again Transforms Himself into an
Angel of Light, i.e., against the New Interim, by Carolus
Azarias Gotsburgensis, 1549."Of this book, too, Flacius
was the author; (Preger 1, 67.)-"Apology
(Entschuldigung) of Matthias Flacius Illy. to a Certain
Pastor," 1549.-"Several Letters of the Venerable D. M.
Luther concerning the Union of Christ and Belial,
Written 1530 to the Theologians at the Diet in
Augsburg," 1549, with a preface by Flacius.-"Apology
of Matthias Flacius Illy., Addressed to the University of
Wittenberg, regarding the Adiaphora,"1549.-"Writing
of Matthias Flacius Illy. against a Truly Heathen, yea,
Epicurean Book of the Adiaphorists (in which the
Leipzig Interim is Defended) in Order to Guard Oneself
against the Present Counterfeiters of the True Religion,"
1549.-"Answer of Magister Nicolas Gallus and
Matthias Flacius Illy. to the Letter of Some Preachers in
Meissen regarding the Question whether One should
Abandon His Parish rather than Don the Cassock"
(linea vestis, Chorrock).-"Against the Extract of the
Leipzig Interim, or the Small Interim," by Flacius,
1549.-"Book concerning True and False Adiaphora
(Liber de Veris et Falsis Adiaphoris), in which the
Adiaphoristic Controversy is Explained Almost in Its
Entirety, by Flacius, 1549."This book, which is most frequently
quoted and deals most thoroughly with the
questions involved, is found in Schluesselburg's
Catalogus Haereticorum 13, 154ff.-"An Admonition
(Vermahnung) to be Constant in the Confession of the
Truth, in Cross and Prayer, by Flacius," 1549.-"A
Christian Admonition by Matthias Flacius Illy. to be
Constant in the True, Pure Religion of Jesus Christ and
in the Augsburg Confession," 1550.-"Against the
Alleged Power and Primacy of the Pope,Useful to Read
at This Time, when the Whole World Endeavors again
to Place the Expelled Antichrist into the Temple of
Christ, by Matthias Flacius Illy."-"Against the
Evangelist of the Holy Chorrock, D. Geitz Major, by
Matthias Flacius Illy., 1552."-For a complete list of the
writings of Flacius against the Interim, see Preger's
Matthias Flacius Illyricus, 2, 540 ff

Even the titles of these publications indicate that
the Adiaphoristic Controversy did not lack violence and
virulence. This animosity against the Interimists was
chiefly due to the fear that their policy would finally lead
to the complete undoing of the Reformation. For while
Melanchthon still believed in and hoped for, an understanding
with the Romanists, Flacius saw through their
schemes and fully realized the impending danger. In the
reintroduction of Catholic ceremonies which
Melanchthon regarded as entirely harmless, Flacius
beheld nothing but the entering wedge, which would
gradually be followed by the entire mass of Romish
errors and abuses and the absolute dominance of Pope
and Emperor over the Lutheran Church.The obedience
demanded by the Emperor, said Flacius, consists in this,
that "we abandon our true doctrine and adopt the godless
Papacy." In all its details, he explained, the ultimate
purpose of the Interim is none other than the reestablishment
of Popery, of which even such seemingly trifling
matters as the reintroduction of the Chorrock
(linea vestis) were but the beginning, as it were, the
breach in the dam which was bound ultimately to result
in a complete submersion of Lutheranism. (Frank 4, 74.
76. 119.)

Since the loyal Lutherans, in keeping with the
teaching of Luther and the Lutheran Confessions,
regarded the Papacy as antichristendom, they could not
but abhor the concessions made by the Interimists as
treachery against the truth. From the very outset Flacius
and Gallus insisted that their opponents answer the
question,"whether the Pope with his government is the
true Antichrist in the Church as according to the Word
of God he has been publicly declared to be in our
churches, and whether he still should and must be
regarded and confessed as such." And if Luther's doctrine
was to stand, how, then, they argued, could a
union be effected between the enemies of the Gospel
(the Antichrist and his bishops) and the Lutherans
without idolatry and denial of the religion of Christ?
(53. 107.) On the title-page of his Apology, of 1549,
Flacius declares: "The upshot [of the Interim] is the
establishment of the Papacy and the installation of the
Antichrist in the temple of Christ, the encouragement
of the wicked to flaunt their victory over the Church of
Christ and to grieve the godly, likewise weakening, leading
into doubt, separation and innumerable offenses."
(Schaff 1, 301.) Regarding the acknowledgment of the
Pope and bishops by the Interim, Flacius remarked:
"Mark well, here the werewolf (Baerwolf), together with
his fellow-wolves, is placed over the little flock of Christ.
There is, however, no danger whatever; for, as is added
[in the Interim:"The Pope should use his power not for
destruction, but for edification"], they have counted the
sheep and commanded the wolves to be gentle. In my
opinion this is certainly a good adiaphoron to restore
Antichrist to the temple from which he has been
expelled by the Finger of God." (Preger 1, 191.)
Accordingly, burning with shame and indignation, and
trembling with fear for the future of Lutheranism,
Flacius charged Melanchthon with want of faith and
with treason against the truth, and characterized the
Leipzig Interim as an unholy union of Christ and Belial,
of light and darkness, of Christ and Antichrist.

While Flacius thus denounced the Interim as well
as its authors and abettors, he at the same time admonished
and encouraged the Lutheran pastors to be steadfast
in confessing the truth, in spite of cross and persecution,
and to stand by their flocks as true shepherds.
That minister, he said, who denies or fails to confess the
truth, or who yields to a tyrant, deserts his Church.We
must not only confess with our mouths, but by deeds
and actions as well.Not abandonment of the flock, but
suffering is the best way to win the victory over a tyrant.
Flacius also earnestly warned the people against yielding
to the princes and acknowledging, hearing, and following
their own ministers if they advocated and introduced
the Interim.Moreover, he encouraged both pastors
and laymen to resist the tyranny of princes
demanding the reinstitution of the Roman ceremonies.
"A government," said he in his Admonition, "no matter
which, has not the authority to forbid pastor to preach
the pure doctrine." When the government persecutes
the truth,we must not yield, no matter what the consequences
may be.Christians will sacrifice everything to a
tyrannical prince, but not "the truth, not the consolation
of divine grace, nor the hope of eternal life." (Frank
4, 68. 117.)

#### 139. Doctrinal Position of Anti-Adiaphorists.

The theological position occupied by the opponents
of the Adiaphorists may be summarized as follows:
Ceremonies which God has neither commanded
nor prohibited are adiaphora (res mediae, Mitteldinge)
and ceteris paribus (other things being equal), may be
observed or omitted, adopted or rejected. However,
under circumstances testing one's faith they may
become a matter of principle and conscience. Such is
the case wherever and whenever they are demanded as
necessary, or when their introduction involves a denial
of the truth, an admission of error, an infringement of
Christian liberty, an encouragement of errorists and of
the enemies of the Church, a disheartening of the confessors
of the truth, or an offense to Christians, especially
the weak.Such conditions, they maintained, prevailed
during the time of the Interim, when both Pope and
Emperor plainly declared it to be their object to reestablish
the Romish religion in Lutheran churches;when the
adoption of the Interim and the reinstitution of the
papal ceremonies were universally regarded, by
Catholics as well as Protestants, as the beginning of just
such a reestablishment of the Papacy; when the timid
Wittenberg and Leipzig theologians, instead of boldly
confessing the Gospel and trusting to God for the protection
of His Church, compromised the truth and
yielded to the demands of the Romanists in order to
escape persecution when the consciences of Lutherans
were perplexed and confused wherever the abolished
rites were reinstituted. Accordingly, they declared that
under the prevailing circumstances the reintroduction
of the Romish ceremonies was nothing short of a denial
of Christian faith and of Christian love as well.

Flacius, in particular, maintained that under the
prevailing circumstances even such ceremonies as were
in themselves true adiaphora ceased to be adiaphora
and could not be reintroduced with a good conscience,
because they were forced upon the Lutherans by the
enemies of the Gospel, because they were accepted for
reprehensible reasons, such as fear of persecution and
desire for external peace, and because their reintroduction
confounded the consciences, offended the weak,
and gave comfort and encouragement to the enemies of
Christ. The people, Protestants as well as Catholics, said
Flacius, would regard such reintroduction both as an
admission on the part of the Lutherans that they had
been in the wrong and the Romanists in the right, and
as the beginning of a general restoration of the Papacy.
Explain the reintroduction of the ceremonies as piously
as you may, said he to the Interimists, the common
people, especially the Romanists, always impressed by
ceremonies much more than by the doctrine, will infer
that those teachers who reintroduce the ceremonies
approve of the Papacy in every respect and reject the
Evangelical doctrine. In his book De Veris et Falsis
Adiaphoriswe read:"Adversarii totum suum cultum, vel
certe praecipua capita suae religionis in ceremoniis collocant,
quas cum in nostris ecclesiis in eorum gratiam
restituimus, an non videmur tum eis, tum aliis eorum
impiis cultibus assentiri? Nec dubitant, quin quandoquidem
in tantis rebus ipsis cesserimus, etiam in reliquis
cessuri simus, nostrum errorem agnoscamus,
eorumque religionem veram esse confiteamur."
(Schluesselburg 13, 217.) Accordingly, Flacius contended
that under the prevailing circumstances a concession
to the Romanists, even in ceremonies harmless in themselves,
was tantamount to a denial of Lutheranism. The
entire argument of the Anti-Adiaphorists was by him
reduced to the following principle or axiom: "Nihil est
adiaphoron in casu confessionis et scandali.Nothing is an
adiaphoron when confession and offense are involved."
And wherever the Interim was enforced, the consequences
foretold by Flacius showed themselves: consciences
were confused, simple Christians were offended,
and the enemies were strengthened in their error
and emboldened in their attacks and in further
demands made upon the Lutherans.

#### 140. Sophistries of Adiaphorists Refuted.

The Wittenberg Interimists endeavored to justify
their attitude by a series of sophisms to which they also
adhered in the "Final Report (Endlicher Bericht) of the
Theologians of Both Universities of Leipzig and
Wittenberg," 1570. (Frank 4, 87. 2.) By adopting the
Interim, the Wittenbergers, in reality, had assented also
to doctrinally false and dubious statements and to a
number of ceremonies objectionable as such. Yet they
pleaded the guilelessness of their intentions and the
harmlessness of their procedure. They maintained that
they had yielded merely in minor matters and ceremonies,
which were neither commanded nor prohibited
by the Word of God; that this was done in order to
preserve intact the central Christian truth of justification;
to preserve political peace and to save the Church
from ruin; to protect the weak, whose shoulders were
not strong enough to suffer persecution; that in their
concessions they had been guided by the dictates of true
wisdom, which always chooses the lesser of two evils;
and that in all this they had merely followed the example
set by Luther himself. They minimized the entire
affair, and endeavored to explain away the seriousness of
the situation. In particular they ridiculed Flacius for
shouting and sounding the fire-alarm when in reality,
they said, he had discovered nothing but a little smoke
coming from a Wittenberg chimney.

But in the ears of all genuine and earnest Lutherans
their sophistries and apologies rang neither true nor
sincere. The arguments which they employed merely
served to defeat their own purpose.What else, for example,
than disgust, indignation, and distrust could be the
effect on all honest Lutherans when the Wittenberg theologians,
dishonestly veiling the real facts, declared in
their official "Exposition" of 1559 (when danger of persecution
had passed long ago) concerning the reintroduction
of Corpus Christi that they had reintroduced
this festival all the more readily in order that they might
be able to instruct the people in the right use of the
Sacrament and in the horrible abuses and profanations
of the most holy Supper of the Lord in the circumgestation
and adoration of the bread which their critics
[the Lutheran opponents of the Interimists, by their
doctrine concerning the Lord's Supper] strengthened
and that they might thank God for the purification of
tile temple from the Romish idol Maozim, Dan. 11, 38.
(Tschackert, 510.) Frank remarks: "One must see this
passage black on white in order to believe the
Wittenbergers really capable of stultifying themselves in
such an incredible manner. It is a monstrosity, a defense
unworthy of an honest man, let alone an Evangelical
Christian." (4, 61. 113.)

The weak and insincere arguments of the
Adiaphorists were thoroughly and convincingly refuted
by their opponents. To the assertion of the
Wittenbergers that the dispute was concerning mere
unimportant ceremonies which were neither commanded
nor prohibited by God, Flacius and Gallus
replied (in their answer to the question of the ministers
of Meissen whether they should leave their charges
rather than don the Chorrock, lineam vestem induere)
that even with respect to such seemingly most trifling
adiaphora as the cope (Chorrock, vestis alba) one must
not overlook what is attached to it."We do not believe,"
they said, "that the robber will let the traveler keep his
money, although first he only asks for his coat or similar
things, at the same time, however, not obscurely
hinting that, after having taken these, he will also
demand the rest. We certainly do not doubt that you
yourselves, as well as all men endowed with a sound
mind, believe that, since the beginning is always hardest,
these small beginnings of changes are at present
demanded only that a door may be opened for all the
other impieties that are to follow-quod tantum ideo
parva ista mutationum initia iam proponantur, ut quia
principia semper sunt dificillima per ea aditus reliquis
omnibus secuturis impietatibus patefiat." (Schluesselburg
13, 644.)

The Adiaphorists pretended that they had consented
to the Interim in the interest of the weak, who were
unable to bear persecution.But the Lutherans answered
that weak Christians could not be strengthened in their
faith by teaching and persuading them to deny it and
that the enemies and persecutors of the Gospel could
certainly not be regarded as weak. (Frank 4, 78.) The
protestations of the Adiaphorists that they had made
the changes in ceremonies with the very best of intentions
were answered by Flacius in De Veris et Falsis
Adiaphoris as follows: Hardly ever has a Christian
denied Christ without endeavoring to deceive both God
and himself as to his motives. "But one must also consider,
as may be clearly shown from 1 Cor. 10,with what
design (quo animo) the adversaries propose such things
to us, likewise, how they as well as others interpret our
act."(Schl. 13, 217.) "Even though the intention of those
who receive and use the adiaphora be not an evil one,
the question is," said Martin Chemnitz in his Judicium
de Adiaphoris, "whether the opinion of the one who
commands, imposes, and demands the adiaphora is
impious or wicked, whether such reception and observation
is interpreted and understood as a turning away
from the confession of the true doctrine, and whether
the weak are offended and grow faint thereby." (717.)

To the claims of the Interimists that they were but
following the example of Luther,who, for the sake of the
weak, had tolerated Romish ceremonies, etc., the
Lutherans replied: Distinguish times and conditions!
Luther was dealing with Christians who in their consciences
still felt bound to the Roman usages, while the
"weakness" spoken of by Adiaphorists is not an erring
conscience, but fear of persecution. Moreover Luther
tolerated existing Romish ceremonies as long as there
was hope of arriving at an agreement with the
Romanists in doctrine, while the Adiaphorists reinstitute
ceremonies which have been abolished, and this,
too, in deference and obedience to irreconcilable adversaries
of the truth. Accordingly, Luther's attitude in this
matter flowed from pure love for truth and from com-
passion with the weak, whom he endeavored to win for
the truth, while the submission of the Adiaphorists to
the demands of their adversaries is nothing short of
unchristian denial of both true love and faith. (Frank 4,
55.) Brenz declared: "Adiaphora ex suis conditionibus
iudicanda sunt. Adiaphora must be judged from their
conditions.For if the condition is good, the adiaphoron,
too, is good, and its observance is commanded. If, however,
the condition is evil, the adiaphoron, too, is evil,
and the observance of it is prohibited." (Schl. 13, 562.)

Furthermore, when the Wittenberg and Leipzig
theologians maintained that, in preferring the lesser evil
(the Roman ceremonies) to the greater (persecution),
they had merely listened to, and followed, the voice of
true wisdom, the Lutherans replied that moral evils
must not be placed on a level with physical evils, nor
guilt be incurred in order to avoid suffering and persecution.
Westphal declared in his Explicatio Gene regions,
against , quod a Duobus Malis Minus sit Eligendum:
"Impium est, amoliri pericula per peccata, nec ita
removentur aut minuuntur sed accersuntur et augentur
poenae. It is wicked to avert dangers by sins, nor are they
removed or diminished in this way, but rather superinduced
and increased." (13, 251.) "It is better to take
upon oneself punishments and great dangers than to
offend God and to provoke His wrath by such offense."
(250.) "It is better and easier to bear many evils and to
undergo many dangers than to be unfaithful in the least
commandment of God, and burden oneself with the
guilt of even a single sin." (251.) Our paramount duty is
not to escape persecution, but to retain a good conscience.
Obey; the Lord and await His help! Such was
the counsel of Flacius and the loyal Lutherans. (Frank 4,
65.)

But our Wittenberg school will be closed, our
churches will be desolated, and our preachers will be
banished, exclaimed the faint-hearted Wittenbergers.
The Lutherans answered: It is our duty to confess the
truth regardless of consequences, and, at the same time,
to look to God for the protection of His Church. Flacius
said, in De Veris et Falsis Adiaphoris: Confess the truth
and suffer the consequences! A Christian cannot obtain
peace by offending God and serving and satisfying
tyrants. Rather be drowned by the Spaniards in the Elbe
with a millstone about one's neck than offend a
Christian, deny the truth, and surrender the Church to
Satan. "Longe satius esset teste Christo pati, ut alligata
mola asinaria in medium Albis ab Hispanis proiiceremur,
quam unicum parvulum Christi scandalizaremus,
multo vero magis haec et quaevis gravissima pati
deberemus, quam tam infinitis (ut iam fit) Christi
parvulis offendiculum daremus, ecclesiam Satanae
proderemus et salvificam confessionem veritatis abiiceremus."
(Schl. 13, 227.)

As to the Wittenberg School, Flacius said: "It would
certainly be better that the school were closed not one,
but many years than that we, by avoiding confession,
extremely weaken our own religion as well as strengthen
the one opposed to it." (13, 231.) "As for myself, I do
not doubt that, if only the theologians had been steadfast,
the Wittenberg School would have been to-day
much firmer than it is ... The Interim sprang from the
timidity of the Wittenberg theologians ... Even a thousand
Wittenberg schools ought certainly not to be valued
so highly by pious men that, in order to preserve
them unimpaired, they would rather suffer the world to
be deprived of the light of the Gospel. Certe non tanti
mille Wittenbergenses scholae piis esse debent, ut propter
earum incolumitatem velint pati orbem terrarum
Evangelii luce privari." (232.) In a letter to Melanchthon,
written in the beginning of 1549, Brenz said: "If therefore
the Church and pious ministers cannot be preserved
in any other way than by bringing reproach
upon the pious doctrine, then let us commend them to
Christ, the Son of God; He will take care of them; and
in the mean time let us patiently bear our banishment
and wait for the Lord." ( C.R. 7, 290.)

June 30, 1530, Luther had written to Melanchthon,
who was then in Augsburg: "You want to govern things
according to your philosophy; you torment yourself
and do not see that this matter is not within your power
and wisdom ... If we fall, Christ, that is to say, the Ruler
of the world, falls with us; and even though He should
fall, I would rather fall with Christ than stand with the
Emperor." This passage is contained in one of the letters
of Luther which Flacius published 1548 in order to dispel
Melanchthon's timidity, rouse his Lutheran consciousness,
and cure him of his vain and most dangerous
disposition to save the Church by human wisdom
and shrewdness, instead of, as Luther believed, solely by
a bold confession of the truth of God's Word.

#### 141. Theological Attitude of Flacius Sanctioned.

The theological position which Flacius and his fellow-
combatants occupied over against the Adiaphorists
was embodied in the Tenth Article of the Formula of
Concord, and thus endorsed by the Lutheran Church as
a whole. Frank says concerning this most excellent article
which our Church owes to the faithfulness of the
Anti-Melanchthonians, notably Flacius: "The theses
which received churchly recognition in the Formula of
Concord were those of Flacius." The entire matter, too,
concerning the adiaphora had been discussed so thoroughly
and correctly that the subsequent formulation
and recognition of the Tenth Article caused but little
difficulties. (Frank 4, 3f.)

Even Melanchthon, though refusing to confess that
he was guilty of any doctrinal deviations, finally yielded
to the arguments of his opponents and admitted that
they were right in teaching as they did regarding the adiaphora.
In his famous letter to Flacius (who, however,
was not satisfied with the manner of Melanchthon's
retraction), dated September 5, 1556, he wrote with
respect to the Adiaphoristic Controversy: "I knew that
even the least changes [in ceremonies] would be unwelcome
to the people.However, since the doctrine [?] was
retained, I would rather have our people submit to this
servitude than forsake the ministry of the Gospel. Cum
doctrina retineretur integra, malui nostros hanc servitutem
subire quam deserere ministerium evangelii.And I
confess that I have given the same advice to the
Francans (Francis). This I have done; the doctrine of the
Confession I have never changed ... Afterwards you
began to contradict. I yielded; I did not fight. In Homer,
Ajax fighting with Hector is satisfied when Hector yields
and admits that the former is victor.You never come to
an end with your accusations.Where is the enemy that
does such a thing as striking those who yield and cast
their arms away? Win! I yield. I do not contend concerning
those rites, and I most earnestly wish that the
churches would enjoy sweet concord. I also admit that I
have sinned in this matter, and ask forgiveness of God,
that I did not flee far from those insidious deliberations
[in which the Interim was framed]. Fateor hoc in re a me
peccatum esse, et a Deo veniam peto, quod non procul fugi
insidiosas illas deliberationes." (C. R. 8, 839.)

On January 17, 1557, Melanchthon wrote to the
Saxon pastors: "I was drawn into the insidious deliberations
of the courts. Therefore, if in any way I have either
fallen or been too weak, I ask forgiveness of God and of
the Church, and I shall submit to the judgments of the
Church." (9, 61.) In the Formula Consensus, written by
Melanchthon at Worms, in 1557, the Interim is expressly
condemned. For here we read: "With the help of God
we retain, and shall retain, the entire doctrine of justification,
agreeing with the Augsburg Confession and with
the confessions which were published in the church of
Hamburg against the book called Interim. Nor do we
want any corruptions or ambiguities to be mixed with
it; and we desire most earnestly that the true doctrine in
all its articles be set forth, as far as possible, in identical
and proper forms of speech, and that ambitious innovations
be avoided." (9, 369.) The Frankfurt Recess of
1558, also written by Melanchthon and signed by the
princes, maintains: "Where the true Christian doctrine
of the holy Gospel is polluted or persecuted, there the
adiaphora as well as other ceremonies are detrimental
and injurious." (9, 501.)
